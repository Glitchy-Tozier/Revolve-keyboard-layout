Everyone seems to "know" that computers are one-sided. If we had to characterize computers as either logical or intuitive, we would say, "logical." Do computers deal in information or understanding? Information. Are they impersonal or personal? Impersonal. Highly structured or unstructured? Structured. Quantitative or qualitative? Quantitative.
The problem is that we always seem to have a clear notion of the one side -- the attributes we assign to the computer -- while the other side remains suspiciously elusive despite representing our own "human dimension." What sort of personal understanding is intuitive, unstructured, and qualitative? Can we distinguish it precisely from impersonal information that is logical, structured, and quantitative?
But the question rings an alarm bell. It asks for a precise distinction, but precision itself seems to be one of the terms we are required to distinguish. After all, what do we mean by precision if not quantitative and logical exactness? If this is so, however, then we appear to be stuck: clearly, we cannot distinguish precisely between precision itself and something incommensurable with precision, any more than we can visually distinguish between sight and smell. All we can do is contrast the precise with the imprecise, which leaves us firmly rooted to the scale of precision. And yet, the widespread impression of computational one-sidedness suggests that we are at least dimly aware of "another side of the story." Can we lay hold of it?
The conviction that we can underlies every sentence of this book. The issues, however, are complex, and they confound virtually every debate about computer capabilities. When a problem haunts us in this way, we can be sure that we're up against a fundamental question of meaning -- very likely one that our deeply ingrained cultural biases or blind spots prevent us from encompassing.
It so happens that Owen Barfield has spent some sixty-five years circling and laying bare the particular biases at issue here. His first, decisive insights applicable to the relation between computers and human beings date from the late 1920s -- although he was not then writing, and so far as I know has not since written, about computers. Unfortunately, I do not know of any others who have brought his work to bear upon artificial intelligence and related disciplines. My own effort here is a modest one: to suggest broadly and informally where Barfield's work strikes most directly at current confusions.
We can, however, come to understand the computer's limitations. Admittedly, this requires a considerable effort. The computer brings to perfect completion the primary "drift" of our civilization over the past few hundred years. To see the computer in perspective, we need to get outside this drift -- one might also say, to get outside ourselves. Or, to use the language of chapter 11, "In Summary," we must come to ourselves -- experience an awakening of what is most deeply human within us.
What is most deeply human is inseparable from meaning. Unfortunately, the meaning of "meaning" is the most vexed issue in all of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In dealing with meaning, we must come to terms with everything in the human being that does not compute. That is why this chapter is primarily about meaning. If you find yourself wondering along the way, "what does all this have to do with the computer?" then I suppose the presentation may be roughly on track. At the same time, I hope it is clear by the end of our journey that meaning has a great deal to do with the limitations of the computer.
The problem, of course, is that I am no master of meaning, able to orchestrate its appearance in these pages. If society as a whole suffers from its loss, so do I. But I, like many others, am also aware of the loss, and the computer has been one of the primary instruments of my awareness. By considering computation in the purest sense, I have been able to begin grasping what a certain few -- and in particular Owen Barfield -- have been telling us about the nature of meaning.
Meaning, you might say, is what computation is not. But the two are not simple opposites. They cannot be, for then they would stand in a strictly logical -- and therefore, computational -- relationship, in which case meaning would have been assimilated to computation. We can hardly expect the principle that "balances" logic and computation to be itself reducible to logic and computation.
But all that, unfortunately, is itself a highly abstract statement. Let me substitute a metaphor: what I have attempted in this book is to outline the hole I find in society and in myself, about which I can say, "That's where meaning must lie. My meaninglessness gives shape to a void. By entering with a proper sensitivity into the meaninglessness, I can begin to sense the dark hollow it enfolds. And in the darkness there begin to flicker the first, faint colors of meaning."
Moreover, it turns out that the powers of computation, with which so much of the world now resonates, shape themselves around the same void. The meaninglessness of my experience is, in fact, the meaninglessness of a computational bent manifesting within my consciousness, in society, and -- increasingly -- in nature.
The computer therefore may give us a gift: the opportunity to recognize meaning as the void at the computer's heart. And it likewise presents us with a challenge: to overcome the void, or rather fill it with our humanity.
The second sentence raises questions of meaning in a more insistent fashion than (1). If the majority's freedom to act as a majority is itself a threat to freedom, then we need to sort out just what we mean by "freedom." Freedom in what respect, and for whom? Similarly, what is the sense of "worst"? Does it mean "most common"? "Most powerful"? "Most vile"? And how does "determined" -- usually understood as a trait of individual psychology -- apply to a collective?
Despite these questions, however, we pick up the rough sense of this second assertion without too much difficulty, for the thought is not altogether new to us, and we have learned what sorts of qualifications we must give to each term in order to achieve a coherent statement. Ask a group of educated people what the sentence means, and you would expect at least a minimal cohesion in the responses, which is a measure of our (by no means extreme) accuracy in communication when we speak the sentence. So in (2) we have gained a certain richness of suggestion, a certain fullness and complexity of meaning, but have lost accuracy, compared to (1).
With (3) the interpretive difficulties have multiplied greatly, throwing severe obstacles in the way of accurate communication. (This is especially the case if you imagine this exhortation being voiced for the first time within a given culture.) Isn't the definition of "enemy" being rudely turned on its head? If I am to treat my enemy like a loved one, what is the difference between the two, and what is happening to language?
And yet, this very saying has been received by numerous people with some degree of common understanding -- although it is an understanding that may only be born of a sudden and illuminating expansion of commonly held, but inadequate, meanings. It is not that we simply abandon the old meaning of "enemy" -- we are not likely to forget the sting of recently felt animosities, for example -- but a new awareness of possibility now impinges upon that old meaning, placing things in a curious and intriguing light. Can it be that my enemies play a necessary -- a disciplinary or educative -- role in my life? If I treat an enemy as a friend, do I benefit myself as well as him? What will become of the enmity in that case?
Although any group of people will likely generate various explanations of the sentence (the potential for accuracy here is quite low), some individuals, at least, will confess that they have found the meaning to be both sublime and decisive for their lives. The sublimity is purchased, it appears, at the expense of the ease with which we can precisely communicate or explicate the thought.
The strong urge today, in other words, is to seek greater accuracy, and we're not quite sure what other challenge exists. If we could just devise a language free of all those ambiguities about "enemy," "freedom," "determined... then people could not so easily speak vaguely or imprecisely. It seems all too obvious, therefore, that the three sentences above reflect an increasing confusion of meaning -- a loss of accuracy -- and we are likely to leave the matter there.
But this will not do. In the first place, it encourages us to dismiss as empty or shoddy much that is most noble and inspiring in human culture. In the second place, it leaves unanswered the question, What are we striving to be accurate about? For we already have languages nearly purified of all ambiguity -- the various systems of symbolic logic and formal mathematics are just such languages. And the reason they are free of ambiguity is that, by themselves, they cannot be about anything. We can make them about something only by destroying their perfect precision. To apply mathematics, we must introduce some more or less unruly terms relating to the world. But I am running ahead of myself. Allow me to backtrack for a moment.
It is true that vagueness is the opposite of accuracy. But opposites are not what we are looking for. What we need in order to find a counterpoint to accuracy is, as Barfield shows, the relation of polar contraries.
Think, for example, of a bar magnet. Its north and south poles are not mere opposites. Neither can exist without the other, and each penetrates the other. Cut off a section of the north end of the magnet, and you now have a second bar magnet with both north and south poles. It is impossible to isolate "pure northernness." Each pole exists, not only in opposition to the other, but also by virtue of the other. If you destroy one pole, you destroy the other as well -- by demagnetizing the bar.
This points to what is, I believe, one of Barfield's critical recognitions bearing on the computer's limitations: meaning (or expressiveness) and accuracy are polar contraries. At the moment I expect the statement to be more of a puzzle than a revelation. Indeed, as the puzzlements I have already cited suggest, the ideas at issue here prove extraordinarily elusive. I hope, however, at least to hint at the life within this statement.
To begin with, then -- and recalling the magnet's polarity -- meaning exists by virtue of accuracy, and accuracy exists by virtue of meaning. We can neither be meaninglessly accurate nor accurately meaningless in any absolute sense. That is, accurate communication requires something meaningful to be accurate about, and meaningful expression requires some minimal degree of accuracy, lest nothing be effectively expressed. As Barfield puts it:
One way to approach an understanding of polarity is to consider what destroys it. If mathematics, taken in the strictest sense, looks like a language of perfect accuracy, it is also a language devoid of meaning.
But mathematics is not thereby a kind of pure "northernness," for in gaining its perfect accuracy and losing its potential for expressing meaning altogether, it has lost its essential linguistic nature. Can we really even speak of accuracy when a language gives us nothing about which to be accurate? Accuracy in communication can only exist in the presence of some meaning; otherwise, nothing is being communicated.
One can also imagine falling out of the polarity in the other direction. Of course, this is hardly the main risk in our day, but we can picture such an outcome in a rough way by considering the poet or seer who is struck dumb by his vision: overwhelmed by a sublime understanding, he remains inarticulate, lacking the analytical means to translate his revelation even into a poor verbal representation. Here again, then, there is no effective use of language at all.
So far as we succeed in communicating, we remain within the complex interpenetration of polarity, playing accuracy against meaning, but allowing the absolute hegemony of neither. A fuller meaning may be purchased at the expense of accuracy, and greater accuracy may constrict meaning. But these are not mere opposites. If they were, the one would occur simply at the expense of the other. In a polarity, on the other hand, one pole occurs by virtue of the other. An intensified north pole implies an intensified south pole; a weakened north pole implies a weakened south pole. The greatest minds are those capable of maintaining the most exquisite polar tension, combining the deepest insight (meaning) with the clearest analysis (accuracy).
It is important to see that falling altogether out of the polarity into, say, number, typically occurs through a weakening of the polarity. That is, although one may well emphasize the pole of accuracy in moving toward mere number, that very one-sidedness, by weakening the contrary pole, also weakens accuracy itself so far as accuracy is viewed as part of the dynamic of communication. There is ever less to be accurate about. The polarity fades into empty precision that communicates no content.
In sum: when the polar tension is at its greatest -- when both accuracy and expressiveness are at their highest pitch (when the "magnet" is strongest) -- we have the deepest and most precisely articulated meaning. This gives way, via inattention to one or the other pole, to a loss of clearly articulated meaning. It may on some occasions be necessary, therefore, to distinguish between the "empty precision" that results when we abandon the polarity for number, and the "accuracy" that, in cooperative tension with expressiveness, enables our discursive grasp and communication of meaning.
"But what," you may be asking with increasing impatience, "is meaning, anyway?" We will turn toward that pole shortly, but only after looking in greater depth at the more familiar pole of accuracy. You need to recognize, however, that all "what is" questions in our culture are strongly biased toward the analytical. We commonly say what something is by analyzing it into parts, which we can then relate to each other by the precise laws of mathematics and logic. This bias will hardly help us to understand the polar contrary of analysis.
In slightly different words: it is difficult to be precise about meaning for the simple reason that in meaning we have the polar contrary of precision. The best way to begin the search for meaning is by exercising your imagination against a blank -- that is, by trying to recognize the shape of what is missing in the polarity so long as we recognize only accuracy. If a perfectly accurate language cannot give us the world -- or any content at all -- then what can give us the world? Here there is no possible theoretical answer. We must begin to gain -- or regain -- the world in our own experience.
To say "Mary's father was killed in an automobile accident" is to affirm something very different from "The light in the kitchen was on last night." But suppose we say instead,
"It is true that Mary's father was killed in an automobile accident."
"It is true that the light in the kitchen was on last night."
The purely logical affirmation -- that is, the meaning of "it is true that" -- is exactly the same in both these sentences. It is indeed the same in a potentially infinite number of sentences of the form,
It is true that ( . . . ),
where the expression in parentheses is an assertion of some sort. What it means to say that something is true does not depend on the parenthetic expression. So the bare assertion of the truth of something is just about the most abstract statement we can make; it abstracts the one common element from a huge number of descriptions of radically different states of affairs. The logic of my assertion that someone was killed is identical to the logic of my assertion that the light was on. The very point of such assertions is to show "a something" that the subordinate clauses have in common -- something we can abstract from them equally -- despite almost every possible difference of meaning otherwise. That abstract something we call truth (or falsity, as the case may be).
We have seen that, given a pair of polar contraries, we cannot perfectly isolate either pole. It is impossible to slice off such a tiny sliver of the north end of a bar magnet that we end up with pure northernness. We have either north and south interpenetrating each other, or no magnet at all. We found a similar relation between meaning and quantitative rigor, where mathematics represents the pursuit of accuracy to the point where the polarity is destroyed, leaving nothing about which to be accurate. And so it is also with meaning and truth.
The attempt to conquer the pole of "pure truth" results in the loss not only of meaning but of truth as well, for it makes no sense to speak of truth without content. That is why logicians often speak of the validity of a logical demonstration rather than its truth. It is also why they use letters like p and q to stand for sentences, or propositions. For the content of a proposition does not enter into logical calculations; the only thing that matters is that the propositions be either true or false unambiguously. All true propositions -- however diverse their apparent meanings -- have exactly the same meaning for the logician; so do all false propositions. It was Wittgenstein who remarked, "All propositions of logic mean the same thing, namely nothing."
Equating formal logic with mathematics, Bertrand Russell wrote:
On the other hand, just so far as we apply our logic to the world and thereby re-introduce content -- substituting terms with real meaning for our propositional p's and q's -- we lose the logical purity of our truth. If, for example, I say, "All men are mortal," you might ask about the definition of "man": what distinguishes man from not-man in human evolution? Or, what distinguishes man from machine? To clarify such questions I will be driven -- so long as I am seeking logical purity -- to define my terms in an ever narrower way. As one can already recognize in the sciences of biology and artificial intelligence, the word "man" begins to disappear into abstract technicality. Terms like "information," "algorithm," "genetic encoding," "organization," "replication," and "program" come to the fore.
This tendency is inevitable given the aforementioned quest for logical purity. We have to begin qualifying ourselves in an effort to eliminate ambiguity: this term is to be taken only in such-and-such a respect, and that term in a different respect -- and by the time we regain absolute logical precision (if we ever do), we will again have reduced the terms of our proposition to the purely abstract p's and q's of the logician. We will have lost whatever it was we started out to say. For the only statements that remain unqualifiedly true regardless of how their terms are taken are statements whose content has fallen out of the picture.
All concrete, meaningful content resists the absolutism and universalism of logic.
Many are therefore content to dismiss the question of meaning altogether, drawing sufficient satisfaction from their ability to fashion contrivances that work. This willingness to be content with things that work rather than with understanding is reminiscent of the logician's commerce with validity rather than truth. It is the end result of an effort to reduce the polarity to a single pole. A precise, two-valued system ("it works" and "it doesn't work") replaces the drive to penetrate phenomena with human consciousness and so to understand.
We feel comfortable with precision and the abstraction it requires. You might say they are our destiny. Something has led us quite naturally down a path whereby our meanings have vanished into equations, bottom lines, statistics, and computer programs. The causes of that historical drift -- whatever they are -- have proven relentless and all but irresistible. It should not surprise us, therefore, if our effort to grasp hold of meaning in the following sections proves an uphill struggle. Yet without such struggle we may eventually find our consciousness constricted to a vanishing point. For the polarity between meaning and accuracy is also -- within the individual consciousness -- a polarity between fullness and clarity. And we run the risk of becoming, finally, absolutely clear about nothing at all.
I said "crazily" because, while it is certainly true that meaning is not some new kind of thing, it is a prerequisite for there to be any things at all. Every attempt to arrive at the things of our world -- or the things of our theories -- starting from the "pure northernness," the conceptual barrenness, of mathematical or logical abstraction never gets as far as step one. We simply cannot meaningfully speak except by starting with meaning.
Meaning cannot be defined without being assumed, for surely I cannot define meaning with meaningless terms. And if I employ meaningful terms in my definition, then I assume that you are already capable of grasping meaning. Similarly, no one can define definition for someone who doesn't already know what a definition is; nor can anyone demonstrate the principles of logic without relying upon logic.
These "boundary problems" of cognition point us toward a crucial consideration: something in cognition "stands on its own" and is self-apparent. Ultimately, the only basis for knowing anything is that it has become transparent, or obvious, and the only way to discover what it is for something to be obvious is to experience its obviousness "from the inside." One then begins to live within the self-supported nature of thinking.
The alternative is to try to understand thinking in terms of the various objects of thought -- brain, computer, or whatever. But this effort is futile, for the objects are only given by thinking, and therefore presuppose what they are supposed to explain. "The seen is not the cause of seeing, but the result of seeing."
We cannot, as Barfield explains, even begin with ourselves as subjects confronting a world of objects:
That is, both subject and object are determinations given by thinking. They presuppose thinking, which therefore cannot be classified as either subjective or objective.
The first logicians had no rules of logic to go by, and yet they teased out the logical principles inherent in the received system of meanings. Clearly, they didn't do this by consciously applying the very rules of logic they were trying to derive. Logic does not come first in our knowing. And yet, logical structure is already implicit within the purest of meanings. Our meanings are mutually articulated with each other in a manner that is given by the meanings themselves, and we can therefore begin to abstract from these meanings certain empty, universal forms, or possibilities of articulation. These possibilities are what we know as logic.
The grasp of meaning, then, precedes, and becomes the basis for, the eventual elaboration of logic as such. We do not need the rules of logic in order to apprehend meaning. Rather, apprehending meaning with ever greater accuracy is what enables us to extract the rules of logic. Thinking logically is what we find we have done when we have successfully struggled to remain faithful to our meanings.
To be logical in a concrete sense (that is, within the polar relationship) does not mean to act according to an abstract logical calculus, but rather to preserve the coherence of my meanings -- to put those meanings on display without demeaning them by introducing distortions. If I must invoke logic against an opponent in argument, it is not to introduce some new understanding, but rather (as Barfield notes) to bring him to his senses: he has somehow abandoned the intrinsic necessities of his own meanings. He will recognize his error only when he enters more consciously and with greater clarity into those meanings.
To puzzle over the logical justification of logic, the definition of definition, and the meaning of meaning is only to make clear the boundaries of our normal way of thinking, which is governed by a radical slide toward the pole of logic and abstraction. The only way across those boundaries lies in overcoming one-sidedness, which in turn requires not merely thinking about things, but experiencing our own thinking -- including its qualitative aspects. Not much in our culture trains us to do this; we focus upon the "objects" given to us by our thinking rather than upon the thinking itself -- until, finally, some are suggesting that thinking offers us nothing to experience.
If we ever succeed in becoming perfect logic machines, there will indeed be nothing left to experience.
Philosophers have sometimes claimed that sentences like the following are tautologies:
"The earth is a planet."
That is, the predicate simply repeats a truth already inherent in the subject. If we truly know the meaning of "earth," then we also know that earth is a planet. So the remark tells us nothing new. On the very face of it, the sentence purports to do no more than define "earth" -- it tells us what earth is -- so that if we already know the definition of "earth" -- if the terms of the sentence are from the start precisely accurate for us -- we learn nothing. Again, mathematics and logic offer the most extreme example. When we write the equation,
2 + 2 = 4
the equals sign tells us that what is on the right side of the equation is nothing other than, or different from, what is on the left side of the equation. That is what the sign says. If we clearly understand "2 + 2," then we already see that it is the same as "4." There is not some new content in "4" that was missing in "2 + 2."
But imagine you are a contemporary of Copernicus hearing for the first time, "the earth is a planet." Not only is this no tautology, it may well strike you as plainly false. For in all likelihood you view the earth as a center around which both the fixed and wandering stars revolve. You take for granted the fundamental difference in quality between earthly and heavenly substance. The existing meanings of your words do not allow the truth of what you have just heard.
And yet, the time may come when you do accept the statement as true. If we look for the crucial moments separating your unbelief from your belief, what do we see? Words changing their meanings. Specifically, the meanings of both "earth" and "planet" change dramatically. And not just these two words, but an entire tapestry of meaning begins to shift its pattern and texture. We are not dealing here with the sudden recognition of a new "fact," but rather with the slowly evolving background against which all possible facts take their shapes. (In considering the sentence "Love your enemy" we saw a similar transformation of meaning.)
But, of course, this comparison could not immediately recast the entire network of meanings bound up with "earth" and "planet."
The statement remained metaphorical -- a revealing lie -- at first. It would take an extended period for its metaphorical thrust to be generalized and become a matter of routine literalness -- that very period, in fact, marking the transition from medieval consciousness to our modern, scientific mentality.
The differences between the medieval and the modern mind are striking, to say the least. And the pathway from the one to the other is paved with lies! We gain our new meanings by using words to state falsehoods -- but falsehoods that are suggestive, and through which we are pointed to new possibilities of meaning. If Newton had not been allowed to "misuse" gravitas, could modern physics have arisen? For in his day the word meant something like the human experience of heaviness -- not some abstract principle of universal attraction -- and it was still tinged with a sense of "desire." There is a very great difference between the idea of (to borrow Herbert Butterfield's words) "a stone aspiring to reach its natural place at the center of the universe -- and rushing more fervently as it came nearer home -- and the idea of a stone accelerating its descent under the constant force of gravity."
Newton's use of gravitas to describe the force of gravitation was metaphorical -- untrue on its face; it made no more sense, given the received meaning of gravitas, than we would make today if we explained the moon's revolution as resulting from its desire for the earth. And yet, as with many metaphors, it did make sense when one looked through the false statements and, with their essential aid, began to grasp the intended (new) meanings. Assisted by falsehoods, one apprehended (perhaps dimly at first) something not literally stated, thereby allowing the meanings of one's terms to shift and realign themselves with this metaphorical intent. These new meanings, once they are more fully laid hold of and analyzed, enable the statement of truths that again tend toward the literal and accurate (and therefore toward the tautological, the uninteresting), since they no longer require so great a "misuse" of language.
What we discover when we turn to the polar dynamic -- the interaction between accuracy and expressiveness during the actual use of language -- is this continual expansion and contraction of meaning. When I use a new and revealing metaphor, for example, I force static truths into motion, changing, by this "shift of truth," the meaning of one or more of my terms. This meaning, however, is now less explicitly displayed, less accessible -- and will remain so until it is penetrated and articulated with the aid of accurate analysis. When, on the other hand, I analyze and clarify meaning, I narrow it down, distinguish its facets, render it progressively literal and immobile until (if I push the analysis far enough) it is lacking nearly all content -- a fit term for logical manipulation.
Meaning, then, is born of a kind of fiction, yet it is the content, or raw material of truth. And it is important to realize that other- saying -- for example, symbol, metaphor, and allegory -- is not a mere curiosity in the history of language. As Barfield stresses on so many occasions, virtually our entire language appears to have originated with other-saying.
Nor do we gain much by appealing to the physical sciences for exceptions. As Barfield elsewhere points out,
even "high-sounding `scientific' terms like cause, reference, organism, stimulus, etc., are not miraculously exempt" from the rule that nearly all linguistic symbols have a figurative origin. For example, "stimulus" derives from a Latin word designating an object used as a spur or a goad. Similarly for such words as "absolute," "concept," "potential," "matter," "form," "objective," "general," "individual," "abstract."
In sum: when we look at language, we find it continually changing; our discovery of facts and truths occurs only in creative tension with an evolution of meanings that continually transforms the facts and truths. Outside this tensive relation we have no facts, and we have no truths; there is only the quest for a kind of disembodied validity in which (to recall Russell's words) "we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true" -- or else the dumbstruck quest for ineffable visions.
The emergence of meaning is always associated with what, from a fixed and strictly logical standpoint, appears as untruth. And it is just this meaning with which, as knowers, we embrace the world.
The imagination is at work, albeit in less than full consciousness, when we dream. Dreams are full of other-saying -- symbols, images that signify this, but also that. "The dark figure was my friend John, yet it was not really him." Then I wake up and analyze the dream: the man, it seems, was a combination of my friend John and someone I met at the store today who intrigued me -- and perhaps also he had something to do with a certain threatening figure from past dreams .... So whereas the dream itself presented a single, multivalent image, I now have several definite, unambiguous figures, standing side-by-side in my intellect. Analysis splits up meaning, breaks apart unities: "this means that." Logic tells us that a thing cannot be both A and not-A in the same respect and at the same time; it wants to separate not-A from A. It wants to render its terms clear and precise, each with a single, narrow meaning.
And again:
The imagination creates new meaning by other-saying, but cannot elucidate that meaning, cannot draw out its implications and delineate its contours. Rational analysis brings us precision and clarity by breaking the meaning into separate pieces, but progressively loses thereby the content, the revelatory potency, of the original image.
It is not that a metaphor or symbol holds together a number of logically conflicting meanings. The man in the dream was not a logical contradiction. He was who he was. One can experience and employ the most pregnant symbolic images quite harmoniously. The contradictions are artifacts of the analytical stance itself. They appear when we are no longer content with the imaginative unity we once experienced, but want to cleave it with the intellect, resolving it into elements we can relate to already existing knowledge. It is only when the unity is shattered by such analysis that the contradictions between the parts appear. And analysis, once under way, wants to proceed until there are no contradictions left -- which finally occurs when all meaning, all unities, have disappeared. So long as we have meaning, we have a challenge for logical analysis, which is to say that every imaginative unity stands ready to be broken apart by analysis, immediately revealing contradictions between the now too stiffly related fragments of the analysis.
In actual fact, we are likely to see innumerable partial movements in both directions, and understanding is another name for the resulting polar dynamic. The unanalyzed image may be a perfect unity, but it is not "on display" -- it is not available to our discursive mental operations. By contrast, analysis hands over elements of the image to the discursive intellect -- sacrificing some of the given imaginal significance in the process.
But today we too readily ignore that you can neither start with the empty forms of logic in considering any issue, nor finish off an issue with logic. An ironic misconception underlies the frequently heard claim, "it is logically certain." If the matter is indeed logically certain, then the speaker is no longer talking about anything. For if what he says has any meaning at all, that meaning is carried by other-saying -- by imaginative unities not yet fully reduced by logical analysis. The attempt to honor the pole of accuracy over that of meaning does no more than guarantee us the shallowest meanings possible.
It is said that any conclusion of an argument running counter to a theorem of the logical calculus is wrong. Surely this is correct; but it is not particularly helpful. The problem is knowing when a conclusion really does violate the calculus. What about "the earth is a planet," spoken by a contemporary of Copernicus? If we consider only the then-received meanings of "earth" and "planet," there is indeed a violation of the logical calculus. But the sentence also suggests newly emergent meanings, not yet clearly understood. Which is the real meaning?
If the logicians turn their attention to such a problem, they will likely resolve it just when the new meanings have become so stable, conventional, and thin that there is no longer a pressing issue of logicality or truthfulness. By the time you have reduced your subject to terms where the logical calculus can be applied mechanically and with full confidence -- externally, as it were, and not intrinsically in the struggle to be faithful to your meanings -- by then the subject itself is likely to have become so clear on its face as to require no such application.
Further, that movement must be our own; its sole impetus can never be received from without. While meaning is suggestible, it "can never be conveyed from one person to another .... Every individual must intuit meaning for himself, and the function of the poetic is to mediate such intuition by suitable suggestion."
What I can convey to you with absolute fidelity -- although it is fidelity to no-content, nothing -- is only the empty proposition of logic or equation of mathematics.
The manipulation of the products of analysis is in some respects a mechanical task. The genesis of new meaning is altogether a different matter, and its challenge is not often set before us today. In listening to others, do I remain alert for those "strange connections" suggesting meanings I have not yet grasped? Or am I readier to analyze and tear down, based upon my armament of secure propositions already in hand?
The effort to comprehend what we have heretofore been incapable of seeing -- rather than simply to extract the implications of our existing knowledge -- always requires the modification of one or more of our terms: the creation of new meaning. Barfield quotes Francis Bacon:
In an age of abstract and logic-dominated learning, it is easy to forget that all true advance of understanding requires us imaginatively to conceive what is not currently conceivable -- by means of other-saying. Einstein's famous equations were not the cause of his insights, but the result: he had first to become a poet, playing metaphorically with the received, much too logically worn down and well-defined notions of time and space, mass and energy. Lesser scientists failed to gain the same insights because they already knew too precisely. Their terms were rigorous and accurate. As Bacon put it, they could only "prove or dispute" in terms of their existing, systematized knowledge.
What I can do, however, is to offer some final, unsystematic observations to stimulate further thought. These will tend toward the aphoristic, and will partly serve to acknowledge just a few of the issues prominent in Barfield's work. For an extended treatment of these issues, however, I can only refer you to that work itself.
Meaning is whatever Barfield's History in English Words is about. I suspect that for many people this semantic history will oddly present itself as being about nothing much at all. But when the oddity serves as a healthy question mark and a stimulus for further exploration, one eventually enters a rich world of meanings against which the imagination can be exercised. Likewise, all sensitive exploration of foreign cultures leads to the appreciation of strange meanings and, through this appreciation, to a refined sense for meaning itself.
Meaning is whatever the dictionary is not about. I am only being slightly facetious. "The meaning of a word is abstract, just in so far as it is definable. The definition of a word, which we find in a Dictionary -- inasmuch as it is not conveyed by synonym and metaphor, or illustrated by quotation -- is its most abstract meaning."
If we look at the polarity of language, it is immediately evident that the attempt to define -- the quest for a "dictionary definition" -- is driven almost wholly from the pole of accuracy, and therefore tends to eliminate meaning. Meaning, you will recall, "is not a hard-and-fast system of reference"; it is not definable, but only suggestible, and requires the poetic for its suggestion. The strict dictionary definition, by contrast, attempts to tie down, to eliminate any ambiguity previously imported by the poetic. And just so far as such a definition tries to be "scientific," it tends to suffer a steady reduction until finally it knows only particles in motion. Qualities disappear. The resulting, purely abstract term "is a mark representing, not a thing or being, but the fact that identical sensations have been experienced on two or more occasions." These little billiard balls over here are the same as those over there. Abstract thinking is, in the extreme, counting: we count instances, but do not try to say instances of what.
Here is part of a dictionary definition for "water":
Now this serves very well to provide a certain kind of reference, a pointer into a complex mesh of scientific abstractions, in which "water" holds a definite place. What it does not do well at all is give us the concrete meaning of the word in its actual usage -- that is, when the word is used outside the scientific textbook or laboratory, or when it was used any time before the last few centuries. It gives me little if any assistance in determining whether a particular use of the word "water" in a poem, personal memoir, news story, or qualitative scientific study makes any sense. It conveys nothing of that water we enjoy while swimming, washing, drinking, fishing, walking in the rain, or watching storm-driven waves. It misses the wetness, gleam, undulation, deep stillness, engulfing horror, wild power, musicality, and grace. It does not tell me anything about my actual experience of water in the world.
All this, of course, will be admitted. But what will not so readily be admitted is that these experiences contain a good deal of what "water" really means, which is also to say: what it actually is. Our difficulty with this thought, one might almost say, is the defining characteristic -- the crippling failure -- of our day. It is related to our insistence upon a world of objects bearing absolutely no inner relation to the human being who observes them.
As the maker of meaning, imagination has received considerable attention during this past century -- although scarcely from the scientific side. Barfield mentions three features of imagination concerning which there has been a "considerable measure of agreement":
As its name suggests, the imagination deals in images. Barfield has this to say about images in general:
We may think that our good, scientific terms are somehow safely, solidly, material in meaning. And yet, as Barfield points out, "It is just those meanings which attempt to be most exclusively material ... which are also the most generalized and abstract -- i.e. remote from reality."
To see this more clearly, we can contrast abstract with concrete meanings. "Concrete" does not mean "material." Rather, the concrete combines the perceptual and the conceptual -- which together make the thing what it is. To illustrate a fully concrete definition, Barfield asks his reader to imagine a single word conveying what we would have to translate as "I cut this flesh with joy in order to sacrifice." Such a word would not be highly abstract, and what saves it from being so is not only its particularity but also the fact that its reference to outer activity is suffused with inner significances.
But what about our abstract verb, "to cut"? It tries to be wholly material by removing all the particular significances just referred to; but how material is something that has become so abstract you cannot even picture it? The pure act of cutting -- as opposed to particular, concrete acts bearing within themselves the interiority of the actor -- is no more material than a "tree" that is not some particular tree. Words that we try to make exclusively material finally go the same way as "things" in the hands of the particle physicist: they vanish into abstraction.
If we can't give concrete definitions, neither can we define "concrete." The concrete brings us to meaning itself, and to "the qualitative reality which definition automatically excludes."
Barfield again:
And again:
Barfield mentions how, in metaphor, poets have repeatedly related death, sleep, and winter, as well as birth, waking, and summer. These in turn are often treated as symbols of the inner, spiritual experiences of dissolution or rebirth. He then offers these observations:
If we accept and enter into the living terms of the polarity, I believe we will reach two conclusions: (1) there is no limit upon the intelligence we can embed within computers, since there is no limit upon how far the rational principle can proceed in its analysis of any given meaning; and (2) since this intelligence is always a "dead" or "emptied" intelligence -- frozen out of the polar dynamic of meaning and truth, and so rendered mechanical -- it is essentially limited.
These contentions are not contradictory. When I say there is no limit upon computer intelligence, I refer to the programmer's ability to derive an ever more sophisticated syntax through her analysis of meanings. Her next program can always appear more faithful to life than the last. Just so far as we can take hold of a cognitive activity or content and describe it, we will find that it submits to analysis, yielding an internal, rational structure that can be pursued indefinitely toward an ideal of perfect precision.
When, on the other hand, I say the computer is limited, I refer to (1) its eternal inability to transcend meaningfully the fundamental syntactic limits of its own program; and (2) its inability to possess its meanings in the sense that humans do. In other words, you can't take the nonpolar end products of (the programmer's) analysis, map them to the computational structures of a computer, and expect them to climb back into the polar dynamic from which they were extracted -- any more than you can reduce a conversation to a bare logical structure, and then expect anyone to derive from that structure the concrete substance of the original conversation.
These contentions will be disputed by many of those who are busy constructing artificial intelligences. I will have more to say about their concerns later. But for now I want to emphasize the unbounded potential of the computer, which lies in its capacity to receive the imprint of intelligence. And if the computer itself cannot ascend from the "footstep" to the striding foot, it can nevertheless execute the pattern of footsteps corresponding to a once-striding foot -- provided only that a programmer has sufficiently analyzed the striding and imparted its pattern to the computer.
In other words, even if the computer is cut off from the polar dynamic, the programmer is not, and so the computer's evolution toward unbounded intelligence can proceed on the strength of the programmer's continual effort to analyze meanings into rational end products. Every claim that "the computer cannot do so-and-so" is met by the effort -- more or less successful -- to analyze so-and-so into a set of pure, formal structures.
It is important to understand just how far this can proceed. Through proper analysis we can, if we choose, reduce every dimension of human experience to a kind of frozen logic. This is true, as we will see, even for learning and the grasp of metaphor. That is why the rediscovery of meaning through our own powers of thinking and imagining is so desperately crucial today: we may find, before long, that we have imprisoned all meaning within an impotent reflection of the real thing, from which there is no escape.
We can recognize these issues at work when philosopher John Haugeland, in a standard introduction to artificial intelligence, finally resorts to an imagined "existence proof" to help solve what he calls the "mystery of original meaning." Suppose, he says, that a future comes when intelligent computers
But this is not quite right. We can, without apparent limit, "instruct" robots in all these skills, but this, as I have tried to show, does not even tend to imply that the robots possess meaning in the same sense that humans do. It only implies that we can analyze our meanings and impart their structure to a machine. Nor is it "perverse" to point this out. The real question is whether the futuristic robots would be bound by their syntax -- excluded from the polar dynamic -- in a way that humans are not. That is, would they be stuck where they were, excluded from all progress because unable to take hold of those meanings the emptied traces of which constituted their own logic?
What really seems to lie behind Haugeland's argument, however, is the picture of a future in which we ourselves could not know any significant difference between our machines and ourselves. In that case, it would indeed be foolish to claim privileged status for human thinking. But then, too, there would be a perfectly reasonable conclusion that Haugeland ignores -- not that the robots had somehow gained what he calls "original meaning," but that we had lost it.
In some ways, yes -- but not in the ways that count. The early work in artificial intelligence was fixated upon logic. Somehow the pioneers in the field had convinced themselves that formal logic was the mind's distilled essence. So as soon as they realized that computers could be programmed to exhibit complex logical structures, euphoria set in. Did this not mean that machines could replicate human minds? Alan Hodges describes how these early researchers
Given this outlook, the task was to reduce all knowledge to a formal, logical structure that could then be impressed upon the computer's circuits. There was no lack of bracing optimism: John McCarthy, head of Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, was sure that "the only reason we have not yet succeeded in formalizing every aspect of the real world is that we have been lacking a sufficiently powerful logical calculus. I am currently working on that problem."
More recent years have seen a considerable backlash against the dominance of logic in artificial intelligence. This backlash is associated with, among other things, the analysis of common sense and background knowledge, the flourishing of connectionism, and the investigation of human reasoning itself.
But this statement easily misleads -- in two ways. First, it is not so much that human beings have been convicted of irrationality as that cognitive scientists were betrayed by assumptions that flew extraordinarily wide of the mark. Their faith convinced them that cognitive behavior would be found on its surface to be nothing but the perfectly well-behaved end products of logical analysis -- as if human beings started from a position of ideally structured (and therefore meaningless) emptiness. As if, that is, the meanings with which we operate were already so thoroughly worn down as to yield a neat calculus of thinking or behavior after a single level of analysis. We may be moving toward such emptiness, but, thankfully, we are not there yet.
This mistaken expectation was so egregious as to beg for some sort of explanation. At the very least, we can say that the misfiring was clearly related to the disregard of meaning so characteristic of the cognitive sciences. Researchers who could posit a mentality built up of nothing but logical forms must have trained themselves over a lifetime to ignore as mere fluff the meanings, the qualities, the presence of their own minds. This bizarre and simplistic rendering of their own thinking processes fits well with what I suggested earlier: it may be we who are approaching the status of robots rather than robots who are approaching human status.
Moreover, that the errors of the early researchers have not been remedied by the subsequent reaction is evident when we consider the second way the statement above can mislead us.
Despite all the confessions (usually made on behalf of others!) about the one-sided approach to computer models of mind, the current work is most definitely not aimed at redressing the imbalance. The researchers have merely been forced to give up all hope of deriving (and programming) the necessary logical formalism based on a first- level analysis of human behavior. We too obviously do not present ourselves on the surface as logic machines.
In other words, the programmer cannot simply look offhand for those finished, empty structures she would imprint upon the computer's receptive circuits. She must, it is now recognized, carry out extensive "semantic analysis" -- the analysis of meaning. Which is to say that she can obtain the desired structures only through laborious toil within the constraints of the polar dynamic of meaning. Only by first entering into meaning can she succeed in breaking it down, and even then she must resort to analysis after analysis -- almost, it appears, without end. And yet, the work always yields some results, and there is no definable limit upon how far it can proceed.
But the point is that, while the programmer is driven to pursue the polar dynamic, her entire purpose is to derive for the computer those same empty structures that her predecessors would have liked to pluck straight from the surface convolutions of their brains. That is, as a programmer she is forced to work with the polarity, but she does so in order to destroy it. For that is the only way she can satisfy the computer's hunger for absolute precision about nothing at all. Every approximation, every heuristic, every "synthesis" must be precisely and logically constructed from the eviscerated end products of analysis.
Nor is any of this surprising, for the computer itself is above all else a logic machine. Of the many researchers who believe computers will some day think and otherwise manifest humanlike intelligence, few if any now imagine that the thinking robot of the future will, in its ruling intelligence, leap the bounds of a formal system.
So, for all the recognition of the "limits of logic and rationality," the one-sided pursuit of the purified end products of analysis remains the untarnished grail quest of those who would sculpt a lump of silicon into the shape of a human mind. In this we do not witness the discovery of polarity, but something more like flight from it.
A great deal hinges on the distinction Barfield drew back in the 1920s, between true and accidental metaphor. The latter is based on an analysis of complex ideas, whose parts then can be recombined according to one or another logical scheme. This is quite different from the activity of the primary imagination, which is responsible for those more fundamental unities from which complex ideas are constructed.
You will remember that the poetic principle creates the individual terms whose "external," logical relationships can then be manipulated by the rational principle. The difference between true and accidental metaphor is the difference between the creation or modification of terms, and the mere rearrangement of existing terms.
It is not that accidental metaphors have no value. They can be useful, Barfield notes, "in the exposition of an argument, and in the calling up of clear visual images, as when I ask you to think of the earth as a great orange with a knitting needle struck through it -- or call the sky an inverted bowl -- two images in which there can at least be no more than a minimum of poetic truth." He adds that such metaphors usually carry "a suggestion of having been constructed upon a sort of framework of logic."
When I call the earth an orange with a knitting needle stuck through it, the ratio (a knitting needle is to an orange as its axis of rotation is to the earth) is not likely to be the vehicle of imaginative insight. Axis and knitting needle, earth and orange, hardly constitute revelatory unities, in and of themselves. But we can arrange a needle and orange in such a way as to represent, abstractly, the relation of axis to earth, and this may be a valuable teaching aid. The metaphor, however, will effect little modification of its constituent terms; we will not come to understand either knitting needles or planetary axes differently as a result of it. Whereas the sixteenth-century European could understand "the earth is a planet" only by reconceiving both earth and planet, the planetary facts we convey to a student with orange and needle remain compatible with each of the terms we began with.
Furthermore, to the extent such a metaphor does lead to new meaning, it is not the sheer logical structure of the ratio that achieves the result. You can play all you want with the relations between terms of a mathematical equation, logical proposition, or any other formal system, but you will not arrive at new meaning unless you call upon something not given formally in the system itself.
The important distinction between true and accidental metaphor can also be seen as a distinction between two kinds of synthesis. The one operates rationally as the "putting together of ideas." But it rests upon a second, more basic synthesis. For the putting together
That is, the imagination (operative in what Barfield calls the "poetic principle") links percept to percept in such a way as to give us those basic discriminations -- changing with time -- that determine what sorts of things our world consists of. The secondary kind of synthesis takes these given things and combines them in various ways -- largely, today, upon a latticework of logic.
You will recall the discussion of linear perspective in chapter 22, where it was pointed out that, in Barfield's words, "before the scientific revolution the world was more like a garment men wore about them than a stage on which they moved." The birth of our own, peculiarly perspectival, three-dimensional experience of space was felt to be a seeing with radically new eyes. And -- qualitatively, meaningfully, in terms of the kinds of things men were given from the world to reason about -- it was indeed a seeing with new eyes.
What carried our culture across that divide was an activity of imagination -- even if it was still largely an unconscious activity. Similarly, the only way to look backward and straddle the divide in thought today is with the aid of metaphor, as when one speaks of wearing the world like a garment. Even so, no formal analysis of such metaphorical sentences can carry us across what must remain an impassable barrier until we suddenly see through everything given formally in the metaphor, grasping it instead as a revealing falsehood. (One prerequisite for this seeing may be many years spent studying medieval culture!) Meaning, as I noted earlier, can be suggested but not conveyed. It cannot be conveyed because there is no automatic or mechanical process, no formalism, that can hold it.
It is interesting to consider a hypothetical, medievally programmed robot living through the Renaissance and beyond. The claim in the foregoing is that this robot's programming could never have prepared it to cope with the transition from a garment-world to a stage-world. As the surrounding culture began to assimilate and logically elaborate the new meanings of a stage-world, the robot born in a garment-world would find the new terms of discussion oddly skewed in a way it could never "straighten out."
This argument, of course, will carry conviction only for the reader who can successfully imagine the differences between these two sorts of world. Such an imagination must reach beyond everything given abstractly, everything formally capturable. After all, the laws governing the propagation of light (and the formation of images on the robot's visual input device) presumably did not change during the Renaissance. The differences were qualitative: they involved, as I point out in chapter 22, such transitions as the one between finding oneself "in the story" of a painting or landscape, and gazing upon the landscape as an observer who has been cast out from it. Or, likewise, the transition some non-Westerners must still make today if they are to overcome the strange and unrealistic quality of photographs.
Machines certainly can learn, in the extraordinarily restricted sense that their current states can be logically elaborated and the implications of those states drawn out. But this is not at all the same as logically elaborating a set of structures derived from genuinely new meanings -- and even less is it the same as apprehending such meanings in the first place. The point with learning, as with metaphor, is that the computer, as a purely syntactic machine, cannot realize any future not already implied in its "past" -- that is, in its programming -- however sophisticated it may be at producing ever more ingenious logical variations on that past. It can, as we saw Bacon put the matter, "prove or dispute" endlessly regarding its received terms, and can be programmed to recombine those terms in every possible permutation. But it will never undertake the difficult task of reconceiving things through an imaginative use of metaphor that makes a "lie" of its previous meanings.
This is a large topic and, I am convinced, the source of many confusions. The standard line tends to run this way:
It is true that at one level the computer deals solely in, say, ones and zeros. But at other levels we see different behaviors "emerging," and we can best describe some of these behaviors in nonmathematical language. For example, we can describe a car as a collection of atoms, subatomic particles, fields, and so on.
(Our description will be largely mathematical.) We can also resort to camshaft, valves, pistons, gears, and the like. Or, again, we can talk about how nicely the car drives us to the supermarket. The language of one level doesn't get us very far when we're talking on a different level.
So, for example, there are those who happily speak of the computer's mathematical determination at some level, while at the same time hailing its artistic prowess, its intelligence, and even its potential for freedom. "After all," they will say, "human beings are fully determined at the molecular level, but it still makes sense to assert an experience of freedom at the level of our daily activity."
The theorist's redescription of his subject matter in moving from one level to another provides a tempting opportunity to reintroduce on the sly and without justification what has previously been purged from the theory. This occurs in the context of many philosophical discussions, including those dealing with the "emergence" of human freedom, purpose, and intentionality. (Intentionality is sometimes described as the "aboutness" of cognitive activity. Human speech, for example, is normally about something in a way that, say, the gravitational interaction between planets is not.)
The place where this illicit smuggling of meaning is perhaps most obvious is in the very first level of redescription, where the leap is from theoretical descriptions approaching pure formalism to descriptions that involve "something else." Surely such redescription is impossible where we have no description to begin with -- no meanings, nothing to redescribe -- that is, where we are dealing with a completed formalism. If, for example, physics has reached a point where we cannot associate meaningful terms with our equations, what is it we are redescribing when we try to relate the theory to, say, chocolate cake? The fact that we can seem to perform this redescription is clearly related to those theoretically illicit qualities we let slip back into our first-level descriptions without acknowledging them.
The question, in other words, is how one gets "things" at all, starting from the ideal of a formal description. The difficulty in this helps to explain why researchers in other disciplines are content to leave the metaphysical quandaries of physics to the physicist. "Obviously enough," the equations must be about something, so one can now redescribe that something by drawing upon all its supposed phenomenal qualities, however theoretically illegitimate those qualities may be. It has often been noted how easily subatomic "particles" become, in our imaginations, comfortingly solid little billiard balls.
In moving between higher levels of description, tracking the sleight of hand can be extremely challenging, because the theorist is allowing himself to play with meanings to which -- precisely because he has no theoretical basis for dealing with them -- he is inattentive. He easily manages to slip from one "reality" to another, without being fully aware of how certain subtle shifts of meaning in his words perform an essential part of the work.
Probably the most widespread, entrenched, and respected gambit of this sort is the one executed with the aid of information. From genetic encoding to computer intelligence, the idea of information plays a key theoretical role. Defined as the measure of a message's "statistical unexpectedness," information conduces to wonderfully quantitative explication, precisely because it simply takes for granted both the message itself, as meaningful content, and the speaker of the message. And, in strict information theory, the message and speaker are indeed irrelevant; they're not what the theory is about. At the higher levels, however, many theorists are all too ready to assume, not that meaning has been ignored at the lower level (which is true), but that it has been satisfactorily reduced and explained (which is false). These are very different matters.
What makes all this plausible is our ability to program deterministic, mathematically describable machines that do succeed in "processing information" -- where "information" is now understood as having meaningful content. If one is willing to ignore the significance of the premier act of speaking by the programmer, and if one manages to lose sight of the necessary polar dynamic of meaning from which that act proceeds, then one can sustain the illusion that information and meaning really do arise of their own accord from an edifice of abstractions.
That this causally grounded interaction between logical mechanism and words is something quite different from the polar dynamic of accuracy and meaning will, I think, be appreciated by anyone who has truly entered into an understanding of the dynamic. But that is a topic I have not addressed here.
But if this is our highest task, it is also the one most difficult to undertake in ourselves or to recognize in others. It is not easy to identify what comes merely from the expression of habit, the play of deeply ingrained associations, the mechanical response to controlling cues in the environment (in other words, from a past determining the future) -- just as it is not easy to identify what is a true taking hold of ourselves in freedom, allowing a new future to ray into the present.
It may be far more challenging to recognize the sovereign, free self than many of us imagine. Take away that self, and we would continue to cruise through life in most of the expected ways. Which is to say that the self is not very prominent. It has yet to waken fully to its own powers of freedom. Such, I believe, is the state in which mankind now finds itself. And yet, it is only in profound wakefulness that we can begin to understand what distinguishes us from machines.
Meanwhile, we are creating intelligent devices possessed of ever increasing cleverness. We can carry this process as far as we wish. It is a process without limits, and yet with radical limits. On the one hand, there is no meaning we cannot implant within the computer, so long as we are willing to identify the meaning with a set of precisely elaborated logical structures. On the other hand, however complex and intricate the elaboration -- however many layers we construct -- the computer as a computational device remains outside the living polarity of truth and meaning. Within the breathing space between these two facts there is doubtless much we can achieve with computers if, recognizing their peculiar nature, we make them the servants of our meanings.
But I hope this chapter will have made the risks a little more visible. Hypnotic fascination with the abstract forms of intelligence, and a hasty rush to embody these forms in electromechanical devices, can easily lead to renunciation (or simple forgetfulness) of the inner journey toward the living sources of our thinking. Yet it is human nature to leave every past accomplishment, every worn meaning, behind. A past that rules the present with a silicon fist is a past that congeals, crystallizes, fractures, prematurely reducing to straw the tender shoots of a future not yet realized. To live in freedom is to grow continually beyond ourselves. The future robots of our fancy could only rule a desolate landscape, for they would be intelligences without live meaning, creatures of vacant form, lacking all substance, condemned to echo futilely and forever the possibilities inherent in the last thoughts of their creators -- a prospect no less gray when those last thoughts happen to express the most sublime truths of the day. These machines would be the ghosts of men, not even desperate in their ingenious hollowness.
When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. And if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature. There is, also, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation; and that, when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying for many generations. No case is on record of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.
As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act in two ways--directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system. With respect to the direct action, we must bear in mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted, and as I have incidently shown in my work on "Variation under Domestication," there are two factors: namely, the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions. The former seems to be much the more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other hand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform. The effects on the offspring are either definite or in definite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner. It is extremely difficult to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which have been thus definitely induced. There can, however, be little doubt about many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food, colour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from climate, etc. Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner. Such facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall-producing insect, shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap.
In definite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races. We see in definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor. Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear in the young of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same seed-capsule. At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise; but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter variations. All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together, may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life on each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner, according to their state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or inflammation of various organs.
With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free state in their native country! This is generally, but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds. I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.
Some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I have given in another work a long list of "sporting plants;" as they are called by gardeners; that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that of the other buds on the same plant. These bud variations, as they may be named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets, etc., and sometimes by seed. They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under culture. As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to assume a new character; and as buds on distinct trees, growing under different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same variety--for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and buds on common roses producing moss-roses--we clearly see that the nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of variation; perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark, by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the nature of the flames.
Changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the flowering of plants when transported from one climate to another. With animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked influence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parents. The great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with these organs in other countries, is probably another instance of the effects of use. Not one of our domestic animals can be named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which has been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable.
Many laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and will hereafter be briefly discussed. I will here only allude to what may be called correlated variation. Important changes in the embryo or larva will probably entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical; thus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that this is confined to the males. Colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants. From facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured individuals escape: Professor Wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of this fact; on asking some farmers in Virginia how it was that all their pigs were black, they informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root (Lachnanthes), which coloured their bones pink, and which caused the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; and one of the "crackers" (i.e. Virginia squatters) added, "we select the black members of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living." Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.
The results of the various, unknown, or but dimly understood laws of variation are infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.; and it is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic, and departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type.
Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance; that like produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical writers. When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both; but when among individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say, once among several million individuals--and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members of the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.
The laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much greater degree, to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be otherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of course confined to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.
Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil--in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the definite action of the poor soil--that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion--that is, to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions and while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations, would be opposed to all experience.
When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature, but the differences in most cases are less in degree. This must be admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species, and by other competent judges as mere varieties. If any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a species, this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur. It has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. It can be shown that this statement is not correct; but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. When it is explained how genera originate under nature, it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our domesticated races.
In attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between allied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing whether they are descended from one or several parent species. This point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely allied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting the different quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently see, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication; I believe that a small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species. In the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated species, there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all are descended from a single wild stock.
It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass and goose, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer, or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied.
In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they are descended from one or several wild species. The argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient times, on the monuments of Egypt, and in the lake-habitations of Switzerland, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble, or are even identical with, those still existing. But this only throws far backward the history of civilisation, and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed. The lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat and barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed several domesticated animals. They also carried on commerce with other nations. All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilisation; and this again implies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation, during which the domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in different districts, might have varied and given rise to distinct races. Since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many parts of the world, all geologists believe that barbarian men existed at an enormously remote period; and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the dog.
The origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain vague. But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts, come to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidae have been tamed, and that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in the veins of our domestic breeds. In regard to sheep and goats I can form no decided opinion. From facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, constitution and structure of the humped Indian cattle, it is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent judges believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors, whether or not these deserve to be called species. This conclusion, as well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle, may, indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable researches of Professor Rutimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons which I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the same species. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive, having bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons, it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian fowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and of others who have studied this bird in India. In regard to ducks and rabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence is clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild rabbit.
The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great Britain! When we bear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany, and so with Hungary, Spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many domestic breeds must have originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they have been derived? So it is in India. Even in the case of the breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from several wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog, pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild Canidae--ever existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. Many cases are on record showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired character; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct races would be very difficult. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimented with this object and failed. The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with pigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the difficulty of the task becomes manifest.
Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed which I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the Hon. W. Elliot from India, and by the Hon. C. Murray from Persia. Many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is something astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a long beak, has a very short and broad one. The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit has a short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding, slightly, the upper part of the oesophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its size, elongated wing and tail feathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all the members of the great pigeon family: these feathers are kept expanded and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch: the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less distinct breeds might be specified.
In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the face, in length and breadth and curvature, differs enormously. The shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a highly remarkable manner. The caudal and sacral vertebrae vary in number; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the relative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body; the relative length of the leg and foot; the number of scutellae on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The manner of flight, and in some breeds the voice and disposition, differ remarkably. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other.
Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would in this case place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species, as he would call them, could be shown him.
Great as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon, I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all are descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them. If the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, they did not breed or willingly perch on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits and remarkable characters, seems improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices, and good flyers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native country; but not one has become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement.
An argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wild rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts; we may look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail. Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree.
Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, with white loins; but the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, has this part bluish. The tail has a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers externally edged at the base with white. The wings have two black bars. Some semi-domestic breeds, and some truly wild breeds, have, besides the two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when birds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed, none of which are blue or have any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters. To give one instance out of several which I have observed: I crossed some white fantails, which breed very true, with some black barbs--and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of an instance in England; and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled. I also crossed a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead, and which notoriously breeds very true; the mongrels were dusky and mottled. I then crossed one of the mongrel barb-fantails with a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a bird of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white loins, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either, first, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within a score, of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed descendants reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency to revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross, and there is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character which was lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion are often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance.
Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the pigeon are perfectly fertile, as I can state from my own observations, purposely made, on the most distinct breeds. Now, hardly any cases have been ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct species of animals being perfectly fertile. Some authors believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility in species. From the history of the dog, and of some other domestic animals, this conclusion is probably quite correct, if applied to species closely related to each other. But to extend it so far as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme.
From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication--these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their not having become anywhere feral--these species presenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with all other Columbidae, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other respects--the occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed--and lastly, the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile--from these several reasons, taken together, we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its geographical sub-species.
In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that the wild C. livia has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds. Secondly, that although an English carrier or a short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two races, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can make, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series; so we can in some other cases, but not with all the breeds. Thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each eminently variable, for instance, the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Aegyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; "nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race." Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court. "The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;" and, continues the courtly historian, "His Majesty, by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly." About this same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will likewise be obvious when we treat of selection. We shall then, also, see how it is that the several breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.
I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, well knowing how truly they breed, I felt fully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been domesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other groups of birds, in nature. One circumstance has struck me much; namely, that nearly all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent-stock, and he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic races are descended from the same parents--may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species?
Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied species. Some effect may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external conditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and race-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon. One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teasel, with its hooks, which can not be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with "everlasting layers" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere variability. We can not suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this has not been their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to have made for himself useful breeds.
The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle and sheep. In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something plastic, which they can model almost as they please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals, speaks of the principle of selection as "that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether. It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases." Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says: "It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence." In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.
What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.
The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. We have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. We see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the "rogues," as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals this kind of selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to breed from his worst animals.
In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever--I speak after careful observation--perhaps never, the case. The law of correlated variation, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it cannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters.
It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have been published on the subject; and the result has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several references to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of the principle is acknowledged. In rude and barbarous periods of English history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the "roguing" of plants by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone states that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.
At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to anything of the kind in the country. But, for our purpose, a form of selection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed. Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as Bakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question have been made long ago, which may serve for comparison. In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed, individuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. There is reason to believe that King Charles' spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our pointer.
By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English race-horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arabs, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights which they carry. Lord Spencer and others have shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By comparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former and present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India, and Persia, we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.
Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection which may be considered as unconscious, in so far that the breeders could never have expected, or even wished, to produce the result which ensued--namely, the production of the distinct strains. The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, "Have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties."
If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.
In plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pears which they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.
A large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries anciently civilised.
In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons. And in two countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of "natural selection," as will hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. This, perhaps, partly explains why the varieties kept by savages, as has been remarked by some authors, have more of the character of true species than the varieties kept in civilised countries.
On the view here given of the important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical, selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus--a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.
Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which is now set on them, after several breeds have fairly been established. It is known that with pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in each breed. The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.
These views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely, that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus improves them, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will have been disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend--perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion--perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes.
I will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the reverse, to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept. Hence number is of the highest importance for success. On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect to the sheep of part of Yorkshire, "As they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly IN SMALL LOTS, they never can be improved." On the other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same plant, are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and valuable varieties. A large number of individuals of an animal or plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are favourable. When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to breed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent selection. But probably the most important element is that the animal or plant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention is paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure. Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species) those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have appeared during the last half-century.
With animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element in the formation of new races--at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds. Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for recently in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal has been surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is exposed when domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I have elsewhere described.
Some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our domestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be exceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been attained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this implies variation. It would be equally rash to assert that characters now increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed for many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life. No doubt, as Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last reached. For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of contraction in the muscular fibres. But what concerns us is that the domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost every character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do the distinct species of the same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire has proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and probably with the length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which depends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and a dray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species belonging to the same genus. So with plants, the seeds of the different varieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the seeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families. The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon, as well as in many other analogous cases.
To sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants. Changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing variability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system. It is not probable that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all circumstances. The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion determine whether variations shall endure. Variability is governed by many unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most important. Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to the definite action of the conditions of life. Some, perhaps a great, effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts. The final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the intercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played an important part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have once been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed. With plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, etc., the importance of crossing is immense; for the cultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids and of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all these causes of change, the accumulative action of selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the predominant power.
On the Theory of Compound Colours with reference to Mixtures of Blue and Yellow Light.
When we mix together blue and yellow paint, we obtain green paint. This fact is well known to all who have handled colours; and it is universally admitted that blue and yellow make green.  Red, yellow, and blue, being the primary colours among painters, green is regarded as a secondary colour, arising from the mixture of blue and yellow. Newton, however, found that the green of the spectrum was not the same thing as the mixture of two colours of the spectrum, for such a mixture could be separated by the prism, while the green of the spectrum resisted further decomposition.  But still it was believed that yellow and blue would make a green, though not that of the spectrum.  As far as I am aware, the first experiment on the subject is that of M. Plateau, who, before 1819, made a disc with alternate sectors of prussian blue and gamboge, and observed that, when spinning, the resultant tint was not green, but a neutral gray, inclining sometimes to yellow or blue, but never to green. Prof. J. D. Forbes of Edinburgh made similar experiments in 1849, with the same result.  Prof. Helmholtz of Konigsberg, to whom we owe the most complete investigation on visible colour, has given the true explanation of this phenomenon.  The result of mixing two coloured powders is not by any means the same as mixing the beams of light which flow from each separately.  In the latter case we receive all the light which comes either from the one powder or the other.  In the former, much of the light coming from one powder falls on particles of the other, and we receive only that portion which has escaped absorption by one or other.  Thus the light coming from a mixture of blue and yellow powder, consists partly of light coming directly from blue particles or yellow particles, and partly of light acted on by both blue and yellow particles.  This latter light is green, since the blue stops the red, yellow, and orange, and the yellow stops the blue and violet.  I have made experiments on the mixture of blue and yellow light--by rapid rotation, by combined reflexion and transmission, by viewing them out of focus, in stripes, at a great distance, by throwing the colours of the spectrum on a screen, and by receiving them into the eye directly; and I have arranged a portable apparatus by which any one may see the result of this or any other mixture of the colours of the spectrum.  In all these cases blue and yellow do not make green.  I have also made experiments on the mixture of coloured powders.  Those which I used principally were "mineral blue" (from copper) and "chrome-yellow."  Other blue and yellow pigments gave curious results, but it was more difficult to make the mixtures, and the greens were less uniform in tint.  The mixtures of these colours were made by weight, and were painted on discs of paper, which were afterwards treated in the manner described in my paper "On Colour as perceived by the Eye," in the _Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_, Vol. XXI. Part 2.  The visible effect of the colour is estimated in terms of the standard-coloured papers:--vermilion (V), ultramarine (U), and emerald-green (E).  The accuracy of the results, and their significance, can be best understood by referring to the paper before mentioned.  I shall denote mineral blue by B, and chrome-yellow by Y; and B3 Y5 means a mixture of three parts blue and five parts yellow.
The columns V, U, E give the proportions of the standard colours which are equivalent to 100 of the given colour; and the sum of V, U, E gives a coefficient, which gives a general idea of the brightness.  It will be seen that the first admixture of yellow diminishes the brightness of the blue.  The negative values of U indicate that a mixture of V, U, and E cannot be made equivalent to the given colour. The experiments from which these results were taken had the negative values transferred to the other side of the equation.  They were all made by means of the colour-top, and were verified by repetition at different times.  It may be necessary to remark, in conclusion, with reference to the mode of registering visible colours in terms of three arbitrary standard colours, that it proceeds upon that theory of three primary elements in the sensation of colour, which treats the investigation of the laws of visible colour as a branch of human physiology, incapable of being deduced from the laws of light itself, as set forth in physical optics.  It takes advantage of the methods of optics to study vision itself; and its appeal is not to physical principles, but to our consciousness of our own sensations.
In studying the rotation of a solid body according to Poinsot's method, we have to consider the successive positions of the instantaneous axis of rotation with reference both to directions fixed in space and axes assumed in the moving body.  The paths traced out by the pole of this axis on the invariable plane and on the central ellipsoid form interesting subjects of mathematical investigation. But when we attempt to follow with our eye the motion of a rotating body, we find it difficult to determine through what point of the body the instantaneous axis passes at any time,--and to determine its path must be still more difficult.  I have endeavoured to render visible the path of the instantaneous axis, and to vary the circumstances of motion, by means of a top of the same kind as that used by Mr Elliot, to illustrate precession*.  The body of the instrument is a hollow cone of wood, rising from a ring, 7 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.  An iron axis, 8 inches long, screws into the vertex of the cone.  The lower extremity has a point of hard steel, which rests in an agate cup, and forms the support of the instrument.  An iron nut, three ounces in weight, is made to screw on the axis, and to be fixed at any point; and in the wooden ring are screwed four bolts, of three ounces, working horizontally, and four bolts, of one ounce, working vertically.  On the upper part of the axis is placed a disc of card, on which are drawn four concentric rings.  Each ring is divided into four quadrants, which are coloured red, yellow, green, and blue.  The spaces between the rings are white. When the top is in motion, it is easy to see in which quadrant the instantaneous axis is at any moment and the distance between it and the axis of the instrument; and we observe,--1st. That the instantaneous axis travels in a closed curve, and returns to its original position in the body.  2ndly. That by working the vertical bolts, we can make the axis of the instrument the centre of this closed curve.  It will then be one of the principal axes of inertia. 3rdly. That, by working the nut on the axis, we can make the order of colours either red, yellow, green, blue, or the reverse.  When the order of colours is in the same direction as the rotation, it indicates that the axis of the instrument is that of greatest moment of inertia.  4thly. That if we screw the two pairs of opposite horizontal bolts to different distances from the axis, the path of the instantaneous pole will no longer be equidistant from the axis, but will describe an ellipse, whose longer axis is in the direction of the mean axis of the instrument.  5thly. That if we now make one of the two horizontal axes less and the other greater than the vertical axis, the instantaneous pole will separate from the axis of the instrument, and the axis will incline more and more till the spinning can no longer go on, on account of the obliquity.  It is easy to see that, by attending to the laws of motion, we may produce any of the above effects at pleasure, and illustrate many different propositions by means of the same instrument.
At several of the recent Meetings of the British Association the varied and important business of the Mathematical and Physical Section has been introduced by an Address, the subject of which has been left to the selection of the President for the time being.  The perplexing duty of choosing a subject has not, however, fallen to me.
Professor Sylvester, the President of Section A at the Exeter Meeting, gave us a noble vindication of pure mathematics by laying bare, as it were, the very working of the mathematical mind, and setting before us, not the array of symbols and brackets which form the armoury of the mathematician, or the dry results which are only the monuments of his conquests, but the mathematician himself, with all his human faculties directed by his professional sagacity to the pursuit, apprehension, and exhibition of that ideal harmony which he feels to be the root of all knowledge, the fountain of all pleasure, and the condition of all action.  The mathematician has, above all things, an eye for symmetry; and Professor Sylvester has not only recognized the symmetry formed by the combination of his own subject with those of the former Presidents, but has pointed out the duties of his successor in the following characteristic note:--
"Mr Spottiswoode favoured the Section, in his opening Address, with a combined history of the progress of Mathematics and Physics; Dr. Tyndall's address was virtually on the limits of Physical Philosophy; the one here in print," says Prof. Sylvester, "is an attempted faint adumbration of the nature of Mathematical Science in the abstract. What is wanting (like a fourth sphere resting on three others in contact) to build up the Ideal Pyramid is a discourse on the Relation of the two branches (Mathematics and Physics) to, their action and reaction upon, one another, a magnificent theme, with which it is to be hoped that some future President of Section A will crown the edifice and make the Tetralogy (symbolizable by A+A', A, A', AA') complete."
The theme thus distinctly laid down for his successor by our late President is indeed a magnificent one, far too magnificent for any efforts of mine to realize.  I have endeavoured to follow Mr Spottiswoode, as with far-reaching vision he distinguishes the systems of science into which phenomena, our knowledge of which is still in the nebulous stage, are growing.  I have been carried by the penetrating insight and forcible expression of Dr Tyndall into that sanctuary of minuteness and of power where molecules obey the laws of their existence, clash together in fierce collision, or grapple in yet more fierce embrace, building up in secret the forms of visible things.  I have been guided by Prof. Sylvester towards those serene heights
"Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind, Nor ever falls the least white star of snow, Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans, Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar Their sacred everlasting calm."
But who will lead me into that still more hidden and dimmer region where Thought weds Fact, where the mental operation of the mathematician and the physical action of the molecules are seen in their true relation?  Does not the way to it pass through the very den of the metaphysician, strewed with the remains of former explorers, and abhorred by every man of science?  It would indeed be a foolhardy adventure for me to take up the valuable time of the Section by leading you into those speculations which require, as we know, thousands of years even to shape themselves intelligibly.
But we are met as cultivators of mathematics and physics.  In our daily work we are led up to questions the same in kind with those of metaphysics; and we approach them, not trusting to the native penetrating power of our own minds, but trained by a long-continued adjustment of our modes of thought to the facts of external nature.
As mathematicians, we perform certain mental operations on the symbols of number or of quantity, and, by proceeding step by step from more simple to more complex operations, we are enabled to express the same thing in many different forms.  The equivalence of these different forms, though a necessary consequence of self-evident axioms, is not always, to our minds, self-evident; but the mathematician, who by long practice has acquired a familiarity with many of these forms, and has become expert in the processes which lead from one to another, can often transform a perplexing expression into another which explains its meaning in more intelligible language.
As students of Physics we observe phenomena under varied circumstances, and endeavour to deduce the laws of their relations. Every natural phenomenon is, to our minds, the result of an infinitely complex system of conditions.  What we set ourselves to do is to unravel these conditions, and by viewing the phenomenon in a way which is in itself partial and imperfect, to piece out its features one by one, beginning with that which strikes us first, and thus gradually learning how to look at the whole phenomenon so as to obtain a continually greater degree of clearness and distinctness.  In this process, the feature which presents itself most forcibly to the untrained inquirer may not be that which is considered most fundamental by the experienced man of science; for the success of any physical investigation depends on the judicious selection of what is to be observed as of primary importance, combined with a voluntary abstraction of the mind from those features which, however attractive they appear, we are not yet sufficiently advanced in science to investigate with profit.
Intellectual processes of this kind have been going on since the first formation of language, and are going on still.  No doubt the feature which strikes us first and most forcibly in any phenomenon, is the pleasure or the pain which accompanies it, and the agreeable or disagreeable results which follow after it.  A theory of nature from this point of view is embodied in many of our words and phrases, and is by no means extinct even in our deliberate opinions.
It was a great step in science when men became convinced that, in order to understand the nature of things, they must begin by asking, not whether a thing is good or bad, noxious or beneficial, but of what kind is it? and how much is there of it?  Quality and Quantity were then first recognized as the primary features to be observed in scientific inquiry.
As science has been developed, the domain of quantity has everywhere encroached on that of quality, till the process of scientific inquiry seems to have become simply the measurement and registration of quantities, combined with a mathematical discussion of the numbers thus obtained.  It is this scientific method of directing our attention to those features of phenomena which may be regarded as quantities which brings physical research under the influence of mathematical reasoning.  In the work of the Section we shall have abundant examples of the successful application of this method to the most recent conquests of science; but I wish at present to direct your attention to some of the reciprocal effects of the progress of science on those elementary conceptions which are sometimes thought to be beyond the reach of change.
If the skill of the mathematician has enabled the experimentalist to see that the quantities which he has measured are connected by necessary relations, the discoveries of physics have revealed to the mathematician new forms of quantities which he could never have imagined for himself.
Of the methods by which the mathematician may make his labours most useful to the student of nature, that which I think is at present most important is the systematic classification of quantities.
The quantities which we study in mathematics and physics may be classified in two different ways.
The student who wishes to master any particular science must make himself familiar with the various kinds of quantities which belong to that science.  When he understands all the relations between these quantities, he regards them as forming a connected system, and he classes the whole system of quantities together as belonging to that particular science.  This classification is the most natural from a physical point of view, and it is generally the first in order of time.
But when the student has become acquainted with several different sciences, he finds that the mathematical processes and trains of reasoning in one science resemble those in another so much that his knowledge of the one science may be made a most useful help in the study of the other.
When he examines into the reason of this, he finds that in the two sciences he has been dealing with systems of quantities, in which the mathematical forms of the relations of the quantities are the same in both systems, though the physical nature of the quantities may be utterly different.
He is thus led to recognize a classification of quantities on a new principle, according to which the physical nature of the quantity is subordinated to its mathematical form.  This is the point of view which is characteristic of the mathematician; but it stands second to the physical aspect in order of time, because the human mind, in order to conceive of different kinds of quantities, must have them presented to it by nature.
I do not here refer to the fact that all quantities, as such, are subject to the rules of arithmetic and algebra, and are therefore capable of being submitted to those dry calculations which represent, to so many minds, their only idea of mathematics.
The human mind is seldom satisfied, and is certainly never exercising its highest functions, when it is doing the work of a calculating machine.  What the man of science, whether he is a mathematician or a physical inquirer, aims at is, to acquire and develope clear ideas of the things he deals with.  For this purpose he is willing to enter on long calculations, and to be for a season a calculating machine, if he can only at last make his ideas clearer.
But if he finds that clear ideas are not to be obtained by means of processes the steps of which he is sure to forget before he has reached the conclusion, it is much better that he should turn to another method, and try to understand the subject by means of well-chosen illustrations derived from subjects with which he is more familiar.
We all know how much more popular the illustrative method of exposition is found, than that in which bare processes of reasoning and calculation form the principal subject of discourse.
Now a truly scientific illustration is a method to enable the mind to grasp some conception or law in one branch of science, by placing before it a conception or a law in a different branch of science, and directing the mind to lay hold of that mathematical form which is common to the corresponding ideas in the two sciences, leaving out of account for the present the difference between the physical nature of the real phenomena.
The correctness of such an illustration depends on whether the two systems of ideas which are compared together are really analogous in form, or whether, in other words, the corresponding physical quantities really belong to the same mathematical class.  When this condition is fulfilled, the illustration is not only convenient for teaching science in a pleasant and easy manner, but the recognition of the formal analogy between the two systems of ideas leads to a knowledge of both, more profound than could be obtained by studying each system separately.
There are men who, when any relation or law, however complex, is put before them in a symbolical form, can grasp its full meaning as a relation among abstract quantities.  Such men sometimes treat with indifference the further statement that quantities actually exist in nature which fulfil this relation.  The mental image of the concrete reality seems rather to disturb than to assist their contemplations. But the great majority of mankind are utterly unable, without long training, to retain in their minds the unembodied symbols of the pure mathematician, so that, if science is ever to become popular, and yet remain scientific, it must be by a profound study and a copious application of those principles of the mathematical classification of quantities which, as we have seen, lie at the root of every truly scientific illustration.
There are, as I have said, some minds which can go on contemplating with satisfaction pure quantities presented to the eye by symbols, and to the mind in a form which none but mathematicians can conceive.
There are others who feel more enjoyment in following geometrical forms, which they draw on paper, or build up in the empty space before them.
Others, again, are not content unless they can project their whole physical energies into the scene which they conjure up.  They learn at what a rate the planets rush through space, and they experience a delightful feeling of exhilaration.  They calculate the forces with which the heavenly bodies pull at one another, and they feel their own muscles straining with the effort.
To such men momentum, energy, mass are not mere abstract expressions of the results of scientific inquiry.  They are words of power, which stir their souls like the memories of childhood.
For the sake of persons of these different types, scientific truth should be presented in different forms, and should be regarded as equally scientific whether it appears in the robust form and the vivid colouring of a physical illustration, or in the tenuity and paleness of a symbolical expression.
Time would fail me if I were to attempt to illustrate by examples the scientific value of the classification of quantities.  I shall only mention the name of that important class of magnitudes having direction in space which Hamilton has called vectors, and which form the subject-matter of the Calculus of Quaternions, a branch of mathematics which, when it shall have been thoroughly understood by men of the illustrative type, and clothed by them with physical imagery, will become, perhaps under some new name, a most powerful method of communicating truly scientific knowledge to persons apparently devoid of the calculating spirit.
The mutual action and reaction between the different departments of human thought is so interesting to the student of scientific progress, that, at the risk of still further encroaching on the valuable time of the Section, I shall say a few words on a branch of physics which not very long ago would have been considered rather a branch of metaphysics.  I mean the atomic theory, or, as it is now called, the molecular theory of the constitution of bodies.
Not many years ago if we had been asked in what regions of physical science the advance of discovery was least apparent, we should have pointed to the hopelessly distant fixed stars on the one hand, and to the inscrutable delicacy of the texture of material bodies on the other.
Indeed, if we are to regard Comte as in any degree representing the scientific opinion of his time, the research into what takes place beyond our own solar system seemed then to be exceedingly unpromising, if not altogether illusory.
The opinion that the bodies which we see and handle, which we can set in motion or leave at rest, which we can break in pieces and destroy, are composed of smaller bodies which we cannot see or handle, which are always in motion, and which can neither be stopped nor broken in pieces, nor in any way destroyed or deprived of the least of their properties, was known by the name of the Atomic theory.  It was associated with the names of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, and was commonly supposed to admit the existence only of atoms and void, to the exclusion of any other basis of things from the universe.
In many physical reasonings and mathematical calculations we are accustomed to argue as if such substances as air, water, or metal, which appear to our senses uniform and continuous, were strictly and mathematically uniform and continuous.
We know that we can divide a pint of water into many millions of portions, each of which is as fully endowed with all the properties of water as the whole pint was; and it seems only natural to conclude that we might go on subdividing the water for ever, just as we can never come to a limit in subdividing the space in which it is contained.  We have heard how Faraday divided a grain of gold into an inconceivable number of separate particles, and we may see Dr Tyndall produce from a mere suspicion of nitrite of butyle an immense cloud, the minute visible portion of which is still cloud, and therefore must contain many molecules of nitrite of butyle.
But evidence from different and independent sources is now crowding in upon us which compels us to admit that if we could push the process of subdivision still further we should come to a limit, because each portion would then contain only one molecule, an individual body, one and indivisible, unalterable by any power in nature.
Even in our ordinary experiments on very finely divided matter we find that the substance is beginning to lose the properties which it exhibits when in a large mass, and that effects depending on the individual action of molecules are beginning to become prominent.
The study of these phenomena is at present the path which leads to the development of molecular science.
That superficial tension of liquids which is called capillary attraction is one of these phenomena.  Another important class of phenomena are those which are due to that motion of agitation by which the molecules of a liquid or gas are continually working their way from one place to another, and continually changing their course, like people hustled in a crowd.
On this depends the rate of diffusion of gases and liquids through each other, to the study of which, as one of the keys of molecular science, that unwearied inquirer into nature's secrets, the late Prof. Graham, devoted such arduous labour.
The rate of electrolytic conduction is, according to Wiedemann's theory, influenced by the same cause; and the conduction of heat in fluids depends probably on the same kind of action.  In the case of gases, a molecular theory has been developed by Clausius and others, capable of mathematical treatment, and subjected to experimental investigation; and by this theory nearly every known mechanical property of gases has been explained on dynamical principles; so that the properties of individual gaseous molecules are in a fair way to become objects of scientific research.
Now Mr Stoney has pointed out that the numerical results of experiments on gases render it probable that the mean distance of their particles at the ordinary temperature and pressure is a quantity of the same order of magnitude as a millionth of a millimetre, and Sir William Thomson has since shewn, by several independent lines of argument, drawn from phenomena so different in themselves as the electrification of metals by contact, the tension of soap-bubbles, and the friction of air, that in ordinary solids and liquids the average distance between contiguous molecules is less than the hundred-millionth, and greater than the two-thousand-millionth of a centimetre.
These, of course, are exceedingly rough estimates, for they are derived from measurements some of which are still confessedly very rough; but if at the present time, we can form even a rough plan for arriving at results of this kind, we may hope that, as our means of experimental inquiry become more accurate and more varied, our conception of a molecule will become more definite, so that we may be able at no distant period to estimate its weight with a greater degree of precision.
A theory, which Sir W. Thomson has founded on Helmholtz's splendid hydrodynamical theorems, seeks for the properties of molecules in the ring vortices of a uniform, frictionless, incompressible fluid.  Such whirling rings may be seen when an experienced smoker sends out a dexterous puff of smoke into the still air, but a more evanescent phenomenon it is difficult to conceive.  This evanescence is owing to the viscosity of the air; but Helmholtz has shewn that in a perfect fluid such a whirling ring, if once generated, would go on whirling for ever, would always consist of the very same portion of the fluid which was first set whirling, and could never be cut in two by any natural cause.  The generation of a ring-vortex is of course equally beyond the power of natural causes, but once generated, it has the properties of individuality, permanence in quantity, and indestructibility.  It is also the recipient of impulse and of energy, which is all we can affirm of matter; and these ring-vortices are capable of such varied connexions and knotted self-involutions, that the properties of differently knotted vortices must be as different as those of different kinds of molecules can be.
If a theory of this kind should be found, after conquering the enormous mathematical difficulties of the subject, to represent in any degree the actual properties of molecules, it will stand in a very different scientific position from those theories of molecular action which are formed by investing the molecule with an arbitrary system of central forces invented expressly to account for the observed phenomena.
In the vortex theory we have nothing arbitrary, no central forces or occult properties of any other kind.  We have nothing but matter and motion, and when the vortex is once started its properties are all determined from the original impetus, and no further assumptions are possible.
Even in the present undeveloped state of the theory, the contemplation of the individuality and indestructibility of a ring-vortex in a perfect fluid cannot fail to disturb the commonly received opinion that a molecule, in order to be permanent, must be a very hard body.
In fact one of the first conditions which a molecule must fulfil is, apparently, inconsistent with its being a single hard body.  We know from those spectroscopic researches which have thrown so much light on different branches of science, that a molecule can be set into a state of internal vibration, in which it gives off to the surrounding medium light of definite refrangibility--light, that is, of definite wave-length and definite period of vibration.  The fact that all the molecules (say, of hydrogen) which we can procure for our experiments, when agitated by heat or by the passage of an electric spark, vibrate precisely in the same periodic time, or, to speak more accurately, that their vibrations are composed of a system of simple vibrations having always the same periods, is a very remarkable fact.
I must leave it to others to describe the progress of that splendid series of spectroscopic discoveries by which the chemistry of the heavenly bodies has been brought within the range of human inquiry.  I wish rather to direct your attention to the fact that, not only has every molecule of terrestrial hydrogen the same system of periods of free vibration, but that the spectroscopic examination of the light of the sun and stars shews that, in regions the distance of which we can only feebly imagine, there are molecules vibrating in as exact unison with the molecules of terrestrial hydrogen as two tuning-forks tuned to concert pitch, or two watches regulated to solar time.
Now this absolute equality in the magnitude of quantities, occurring in all parts of the universe, is worth our consideration.
The dimensions of individual natural bodies are either quite indeterminate, as in the case of planets, stones, trees, &c., or they vary within moderate limits, as in the case of seeds, eggs, &c.; but even in these cases small quantitative differences are met with which do not interfere with the essential properties of the body.
Even crystals, which are so definite in geometrical form, are variable with respect to their absolute dimensions.
Among the works of man we sometimes find a certain degree of uniformity.
There is a uniformity among the different bullets which are cast in the same mould, and the different copies of a book printed from the same type.
If we examine the coins, or the weights and measures, of a civilized country, we find a uniformity, which is produced by careful adjustment to standards made and provided by the state.  The degree of uniformity of these national standards is a measure of that spirit of justice in the nation which has enacted laws to regulate them and appointed officers to test them.
This subject is one in which we, as a scientific body, take a warm interest; and you are all aware of the vast amount of scientific work which has been expended, and profitably expended, in providing weights and measures for commercial and scientific purposes.
The earth has been measured as a basis for a permanent standard of length, and every property of metals has been investigated to guard against any alteration of the material standards when made.  To weigh or measure any thing with modern accuracy, requires a course of experiment and calculation in which almost every branch of physics and mathematics is brought into requisition.
Yet, after all, the dimensions of our earth and its time of rotation, though, relatively to our present means of comparison, very permanent, are not so by any physical necessity.  The earth might contract by cooling, or it might be enlarged by a layer of meteorites falling on it, or its rate of revolution might slowly slacken, and yet it would continue to be as much a planet as before.
But a molecule, say of hydrogen, if either its mass or its time of vibration were to be altered in the least, would no longer be a molecule of hydrogen.
If, then, we wish to obtain standards of length, time, and mass which shall be absolutely permanent, we must seek them not in the dimensions, or the motion, or the mass of our planet, but in the wave-length, the period of vibration, and the absolute mass of these imperishable and unalterable and perfectly similar molecules.
When we find that here, and in the starry heavens, there are innumerable multitudes of little bodies of exactly the same mass, so many, and no more, to the grain, and vibrating in exactly the same time, so many times, and no more, in a second, and when we reflect that no power in nature can now alter in the least either the mass or the period of any one of them, we seem to have advanced along the path of natural knowledge to one of those points at which we must accept the guidance of that faith by which we understand that "that which is seen was not made of things which do appear."
One of the most remarkable results of the progress of molecular science is the light it has thrown on the nature of irreversible processes--processes, that is, which always tend towards and never away from a certain limiting state.  Thus, if two gases be put into the same vessel, they become mixed, and the mixture tends continually to become more uniform.  If two unequally heated portions of the same gas are put into the vessel, something of the kind takes place, and the whole tends to become of the same temperature.  If two unequally heated solid bodies be placed in contact, a continual approximation of both to an intermediate temperature takes place.
In the case of the two gases, a separation may be effected by chemical means; but in the other two cases the former state of things cannot be restored by any natural process.
In the case of the conduction or diffusion of heat the process is not only irreversible, but it involves the irreversible diminution of that part of the whole stock of thermal energy which is capable of being converted into mechanical work.
This is Thomson's theory of the irreversible dissipation of energy, and it is equivalent to the doctrine of Clausius concerning the growth of what he calls Entropy.
The irreversible character of this process is strikingly embodied in Fourier's theory of the conduction of heat, where the formulae themselves indicate, for all positive values of the time, a possible solution which continually tends to the form of a uniform diffusion of heat.
But if we attempt to ascend the stream of time by giving to its symbol continually diminishing values, we are led up to a state of things in which the formula has what is called a critical value; and if we inquire into the state of things the instant before, we find that the formula becomes absurd.
We thus arrive at the conception of a state of things which cannot be conceived as the physical result of a previous state of things, and we find that this critical condition actually existed at an epoch not in the utmost depths of a past eternity, but separated from the present time by a finite interval.
This idea of a beginning is one which the physical researches of recent times have brought home to us, more than any observer of the course of scientific thought in former times would have had reason to expect.
But the mind of man is not, like Fourier's heated body, continually settling down into an ultimate state of quiet uniformity, the character of which we can already predict; it is rather like a tree, shooting out branches which adapt themselves to the new aspects of the sky towards which they climb, and roots which contort themselves among the strange strata of the earth into which they delve.  To us who breathe only the spirit of our own age, and know only the characteristics of contemporary thought, it is as impossible to predict the general tone of the science of the future as it is to anticipate the particular discoveries which it will make.
Physical research is continually revealing to us new features of natural processes, and we are thus compelled to search for new forms of thought appropriate to these features.  Hence the importance of a careful study of those relations between mathematics and Physics which determine the conditions under which the ideas derived from one department of physics may be safely used in forming ideas to be employed in a new department.
The figure of speech or of thought by which we transfer the language and ideas of a familiar science to one with which we are less acquainted may be called Scientific Metaphor.
Thus the words Velocity, Momentum, Force, &c. have acquired certain precise meanings in Elementary Dynamics.  They are also employed in the Dynamics of a Connected System in a sense which, though perfectly analogous to the elementary sense, is wider and more general.
These generalized forms of elementary ideas may be called metaphorical terms in the sense in which every abstract term is metaphorical.  The characteristic of a truly scientific system of metaphors is that each term in its metaphorical use retains all the formal relations to the other terms of the system which it had in its original use.  The method is then truly scientific--that is, not only a legitimate product of science, but capable of generating science in its turn.
There are certain electrical phenomena, again, which are connected together by relations of the same form as those which connect dynamical phenomena.  To apply to these the phrases of dynamics with proper distinctions and provisional reservations is an example of a metaphor of a bolder kind; but it is a legitimate metaphor if it conveys a true idea of the electrical relations to those who have been already trained in dynamics.
Suppose, then, that we have successfully introduced certain ideas belonging to an elementary science by applying them metaphorically to some new class of phenomena.  It becomes an important philosophical question to determine in what degree the applicability of the old ideas to the new subject may be taken as evidence that the new phenomena are physically similar to the old.
The best instances for the determination of this question are those in which two different explanations have been given of the same thing.
The most celebrated case of this kind is that of the corpuscular and the undulatory theories of light.  Up to a certain point the phenomena of light are equally well explained by both; beyond this point, one of them fails.
To understand the true relation of these theories in that part of the field where they seem equally applicable we must look at them in the light which Hamilton has thrown upon them by his discovery that to every brachistochrone problem there corresponds a problem of free motion, involving different velocities and times, but resulting in the same geometrical path.  Professor Tait has written a very interesting paper on this subject.
According to a theory of electricity which is making great progress in Germany, two electrical particles act on one another directly at a distance, but with a force which, according to Weber, depends on their relative velocity, and according to a theory hinted at by Gauss, and developed by Riemann, Lorenz, and Neumann, acts not instantaneously, but after a time depending on the distance.  The power with which this theory, in the hands of these eminent men, explains every kind of electrical phenomena must be studied in order to be appreciated.
Another theory of electricity, which I prefer, denies action at a distance and attributes electric action to tensions and pressures in an all-pervading medium, these stresses being the same in kind with those familiar to engineers, and the medium being identical with that in which light is supposed to be propagated.
Both these theories are found to explain not only the phenomena by the aid of which they were originally constructed, but other phenomena, which were not thought of or perhaps not known at the time; and both have independently arrived at the same numerical result, which gives the absolute velocity of light in terms of electrical quantities.
That theories apparently so fundamentally opposed should have so large a field of truth common to both is a fact the philosophical importance of which we cannot fully appreciate till we have reached a scientific altitude from which the true relation between hypotheses so different can be seen.
I shall only make one more remark on the relation between Mathematics and Physics.  In themselves, one is an operation of the mind, the other is a dance of molecules.  The molecules have laws of their own, some of which we select as most intelligible to us and most amenable to our calculation.  We form a theory from these partial data, and we ascribe any deviation of the actual phenomena from this theory to disturbing causes.  At the same time we confess that what we call disturbing causes are simply those parts of the true circumstances which we do not know or have neglected, and we endeavour in future to take account of them.  We thus acknowledge that the so-called disturbance is a mere figment of the mind, not a fact of nature, and that in natural action there is no disturbance.
But this is not the only way in which the harmony of the material with the mental operation may be disturbed.  The mind of the mathematician is subject to many disturbing causes, such as fatigue, loss of memory, and hasty conclusions; and it is found that, from these and other causes, mathematicians make mistakes.
I am not prepared to deny that, to some mind of a higher order than ours, each of these errors might be traced to the regular operation of the laws of actual thinking; in fact we ourselves often do detect, not only errors of calculation, but the causes of these errors.  This, however, by no means alters our conviction that they are errors, and that one process of thought is right and another process wrong.  I One of the most profound mathematicians and thinkers of our time, the late George Boole, when reflecting on the precise and almost mathematical character of the laws of right thinking as compared with the exceedingly perplexing though perhaps equally determinate laws of actual and fallible thinking, was led to another of those points of view from which Science seems to look out into a region beyond her own domain.
"We must admit," he says, "that there exist laws" (of thought) "which even the rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve from violation.  We must ascribe to them an authority, the essence of which does not consist in power, a supremacy which the analogy of the inviolable order of the natural world in no way assists us to comprehend."
The University of Cambridge, in accordance with that law of its evolution, by which, while maintaining the strictest continuity between the successive phases of its history, it adapts itself with more or less promptness to the requirements of the times, has lately instituted a course of Experimental Physics.  This course of study, while it requires us to maintain in action all those powers of attention and analysis which have been so long cultivated in the University, calls on us to exercise our senses in observation, and our hands in manipulation.  The familiar apparatus of pen, ink, and paper will no longer be sufficient for us, and we shall require more room than that afforded by a seat at a desk, and a wider area than that of the black board.  We owe it to the munificence of our Chancellor, that, whatever be the character in other respects of the experiments which we hope hereafter to conduct, the material facilities for their full development will be upon a scale which has not hitherto been surpassed.
The main feature, therefore, of Experimental Physics at Cambridge is the Devonshire Physical Laboratory, and I think it desirable that on the present occasion, before we enter on the details of any special study, we should consider by what means we, the University of Cambridge, may, as a living body, appropriate and vitalise this new organ, the outward shell of which we expect soon to rise before us. The course of study at this University has always included Natural Philosophy, as well as Pure Mathematics.  To diffuse a sound knowledge of Physics, and to imbue the minds of our students with correct dynamical principles, have been long regarded as among our highest functions, and very few of us can now place ourselves in the mental condition in which even such philosophers as the great Descartes were involved in the days before Newton had announced the true laws of the motion of bodies.  Indeed the cultivation and diffusion of sound dynamical ideas has already effected a great change in the language and thoughts even of those who make no pretensions to science, and we are daily receiving fresh proofs that the popularisation of scientific doctrines is producing as great an alteration in the mental state of society as the material applications of science are effecting in its outward life.  Such indeed is the respect paid to science, that the most absurd opinions may become current, provided they are expressed in language, the sound of which recals some well-known scientific phrase.  If society is thus prepared to receive all kinds of scientific doctrines, it is our part to provide for the diffusion and cultivation, not only of true scientific principles, but of a spirit of sound criticism, founded on an examination of the evidences on which statements apparently scientific depend.
When we shall be able to employ in scientific education, not only the trained attention of the student, and his familiarity with symbols, but the keenness of his eye, the quickness of his ear, the delicacy of his touch, and the adroitness of his fingers, we shall not only extend our influence over a class of men who are not fond of cold abstractions, but, by opening at once all the gateways of knowledge, we shall ensure the association of the doctrines of science with those elementary sensations which form the obscure background of all our conscious thoughts, and which lend a vividness and relief to ideas, which, when presented as mere abstract terms, are apt to fade entirely from the memory.
In a course of Experimental Physics we may consider either the Physics or the Experiments as the leading feature.  We may either employ the experiments to illustrate the phenomena of a particular branch of Physics, or we may make some physical research in order to exemplify a particular experimental method.  In the order of time, we should begin, in the Lecture Room, with a course of lectures on some branch of Physics aided by experiments of illustration, and conclude, in the Laboratory, with a course of experiments of research.
Let me say a few words on these two classes of experiments,--Experiments of Illustration and Experiments of Research. The aim of an experiment of illustration is to throw light upon some scientific idea so that the student may be enabled to grasp it.  The circumstances of the experiment are so arranged that the phenomenon which we wish to observe or to exhibit is brought into prominence, instead of being obscured and entangled among other phenomena, as it is when it occurs in the ordinary course of nature.  To exhibit illustrative experiments, to encourage others to make them, and to cultivate in every way the ideas on which they throw light, forms an important part of our duty.  The simpler the materials of an illustrative experiment, and the more familiar they are to the student, the more thoroughly is he likely to acquire the idea which it is meant to illustrate.  The educational value of such experiments is often inversely proportional to the complexity of the apparatus.  The student who uses home-made apparatus, which is always going wrong, often learns more than one who has the use of carefully adjusted instruments, to which he is apt to trust, and which he dares not take to pieces.
It is very necessary that those who are trying to learn from books the facts of physical science should be enabled by the help of a few illustrative experiments to recognise these facts when they meet with them out of doors.  Science appears to us with a very different aspect after we have found out that it is not in lecture rooms only, and by means of the electric light projected on a screen, that we may witness physical phenomena, but that we may find illustrations of the highest doctrines of science in games and gymnastics, in travelling by land and by water, in storms of the air and of the sea, and wherever there is matter in motion.
This habit of recognising principles amid the endless variety of their action can never degrade our sense of the sublimity of nature, or mar our enjoyment of its beauty.  On the contrary, it tends to rescue our scientific ideas from that vague condition in which we too often leave them, buried among the other products of a lazy credulity, and to raise them into their proper position among the doctrines in which our faith is so assured, that we are ready at all times to act on them.
Experiments of illustration may be of very different kinds.  Some may be adaptations of the commonest operations of ordinary life, others may be carefully arranged exhibitions of some phenomenon which occurs only under peculiar conditions.  They all, however, agree in this, that their aim is to present some phenomenon to the senses of the student in such a way that he may associate with it the appropriate scientific idea.  When he has grasped this idea, the experiment which illustrates it has served its purpose.
In an experiment of research, on the other hand, this is not the principal aim.  It is true that an experiment, in which the principal aim is to see what happens under certain conditions, may be regarded as an experiment of research by those who are not yet familiar with the result, but in experimental researches, strictly so called, the ultimate object is to measure something which we have already seen--to obtain a numerical estimate of some magnitude.
Experiments of this class--those in which measurement of some kind is involved, are the proper work of a Physical Laboratory.  In every experiment we have first to make our senses familiar with the phenomenon, but we must not stop here, we must find out which of its features are capable of measurement, and what measurements are required in order to make a complete specification of the phenomenon. We must then make these measurements, and deduce from them the result which we require to find.
This characteristic of modern experiments--that they consist principally of measurements,--is so prominent, that the opinion seems to have got abroad, that in a few years all the great physical constants will have been approximately estimated, and that the only occupation which will then be left to men of science will be to carry on these measurements to another place of decimals.
If this is really the state of things to which we are approaching, our Laboratory may perhaps become celebrated as a place of conscientious labour and consummate skill, but it will be out of place in the University, and ought rather to be classed with the other great workshops of our country, where equal ability is directed to more useful ends.
But we have no right to think thus of the unsearchable riches of creation, or of the untried fertility of those fresh minds into which these riches will continue to be poured.  It may possibly be true that, in some of those fields of discovery which lie open to such rough observations as can be made without artificial methods, the great explorers of former times have appropriated most of what is valuable, and that the gleanings which remain are sought after, rather for their abstruseness, than for their intrinsic worth.  But the history of science shews that even during that phase of her progress in which she devotes herself to improving the accuracy of the numerical measurement of quantities with which she has long been familiar, she is preparing the materials for the subjugation of new regions, which would have remained unknown if she had been contented with the rough methods of her early pioneers.  I might bring forward instances gathered from every branch of science, shewing how the labour of careful measurement has been rewarded by the discovery of new fields of research, and by the development of new scientific ideas.  But the history of the science of terrestrial magnetism affords us a sufficient example of what may be done by Experiments in Concert, such as we hope some day to perform in our Laboratory.
That celebrated traveller, Humboldt, was profoundly impressed with the scientific value of a combined effort to be made by the observers of all nations, to obtain accurate measurements of the magnetism of the earth; and we owe it mainly to his enthusiasm for science, his great reputation and his wide-spread influence, that not only private men of science, but the governments of most of the civilised nations, our own among the number, were induced to take part in the enterprise.  But the actual working out of the scheme, and the arrangements by which the labours of the observers were so directed as to obtain the best results, we owe to the great mathematician Gauss, working along with Weber, the future founder of the science of electro-magnetic measurement, in the magnetic observatory of Gottingen, and aided by the skill of the instrument-maker Leyser.  These men, however, did not work alone.  Numbers of scientific men joined the Magnetic Union, learned the use of the new instruments and the new methods of reducing the observations; and in every city of Europe you might see them, at certain stated times, sitting, each in his cold wooden shed, with his eye fixed at the telescope, his ear attentive to the clock, and his pencil recording in his note-book the instantaneous position of the suspended magnet.
Bacon's conception of "Experiments in concert" was thus realised, the scattered forces of science were converted into a regular army, and emulation and jealousy became out of place, for the results obtained by any one observer were of no value till they were combined with those of the others.
The increase in the accuracy and completeness of magnetic observations which was obtained by the new method, opened up fields of research which were hardly suspected to exist by those whose observations of the magnetic needle had been conducted in a more primitive manner.  We must reserve for its proper place in our course any detailed description of the disturbances to which the magnetism of our planet is found to be subject.  Some of these disturbances are periodic, following the regular courses of the sun and moon.  Others are sudden, and are called magnetic storms, but, like the storms of the atmosphere, they have their known seasons of frequency.  The last and the most mysterious of these magnetic changes is that secular variation by which the whole character of the earth, as a great magnet, is being slowly modified, while the magnetic poles creep on, from century to century, along their winding track in the polar regions.
We have thus learned that the interior of the earth is subject to the influences of the heavenly bodies, but that besides this there is a constantly progressive change going on, the cause of which is entirely unknown.  In each of the magnetic observatories throughout the world an arrangement is at work, by means of which a suspended magnet directs a ray of light on a preparred sheet of paper moved by clockwork.  On that paper the never-resting heart of the earth is now tracing, in telegraphic symbols which will one day be interpreted, a record of its pulsations and its flutterings, as well as of that slow but mighty working which warns us that we must not suppose that the inner history of our planet is ended.
But this great experimental research on Terrestrial Magnetism produced lasting effects on the progress of science in general.  I need only mention one or two instances.  The new methods of measuring forces were successfully applied by Weber to the numerical determination of all the phenomena of electricity, and very soon afterwards the electric telegraph, by conferring a commercial value on exact numerical measurements, contributed largely to the advancement, as well as to the diffusion of scientific knowledge.
But it is not in these more modern branches of science alone that this influence is felt.  It is to Gauss, to the Magnetic Union, and to magnetic observers in general, that we owe our deliverance from that absurd method of estimating forces by a variable standard which prevailed so long even among men of science.  It was Gauss who first based the practical measurement of magnetic force (and therefore of every other force) on those long established principles, which, though they are embodied in every dynamical equation, have been so generally set aside, that these very equations, though correctly given in our Cambridge textbooks, are usually explained there by assuming, in addition to the variable standard of force, a variable, and therefore illegal, standard of mass.
Such, then, were some of the scientific results which followed in this case from bringing together mathematical power, experimental sagacity, and manipulative skill, to direct and assist the labours of a body of zealous observers.  If therefore we desire, for our own advantage and for the honour of our University, that the Devonshire Laboratory should be successful, we must endeavour to maintain it in living union with the other organs and faculties of our learned body.  We shall therefore first consider the relation in which we stand to those mathematical studies which have so long flourished among us, which deal with our own subjects, and which differ from our experimental studies only in the mode in which they are presented to the mind.
There is no more powerful method for introducing knowledge into the mind than that of presenting it in as many different ways as we can. When the ideas, after entering through different gateways, effect a junction in the citadel of the mind, the position they occupy becomes impregnable.  Opticians tell us that the mental combination of the views of an object which we obtain from stations no further apart than our two eyes is sufficient to produce in our minds an impression of the solidity of the object seen; and we find that this impression is produced even when we are aware that we are really looking at two flat pictures placed in a stereoscope.  It is therefore natural to expect that the knowledge of physical science obtained by the combined use of mathematical analysis and experimental research will be of a more solid, available, and enduring kind than that possessed by the mere mathematician or the mere experimenter.
But what will be the effect on the University, if men Pursuing that course of reading which has produced so many distinguished Wranglers, turn aside to work experiments?  Will not their attendance at the Laboratory count not merely as time withdrawn from their more legitimate studies, but as the introduction of a disturbing element, tainting their mathematical conceptions with material imagery, and sapping their faith in the formulae of the textbook?  Besides this, we have already heard complaints of the undue extension of our studies, and of the strain put upon our questionists by the weight of learning which they try to carry with them into the Senate-House.  If we now ask them to get up their subjects not only by books and writing, but at the same time by observation and manipulation, will they not break down altogether?  The Physical Laboratory, we are told, may perhaps be useful to those who are going out in Natural Science, and who do not take in Mathematics, but to attempt to combine both kinds of study during the time of residence at the University is more than one mind can bear.
No doubt there is some reason for this feeling.  Many of us have already overcome the initial difficulties of mathematical training. When we now go on with our study, we feel that it requires exertion and involves fatigue, but we are confident that if we only work hard our progress will be certain.
Some of us, on the other hand, may have had some experience of the routine of experimental work.  As soon as we can read scales, observe times, focus telescopes, and so on, this kind of work ceases to require any great mental effort.  We may perhaps tire our eyes and weary our backs, but we do not greatly fatigue our minds.
It is not till we attempt to bring the theoretical part of our training into contact with the practical that we begin to experience the full effect of what Faraday has called "mental inertia"--not only the difficulty of recognising, among the concrete objects before us, the abstract relation which we have learned from books, but the distracting pain of wrenching the mind away from the symbols to the objects, and from the objects back to the symbols.  This however is the price we have to pay for new ideas.
But when we have overcome these difficulties, and successfully bridged over the gulph between the abstract and the concrete, it is not a mere piece of knowledge that we have obtained: we have acquired the rudiment of a permanent mental endowment.  When, by a repetition of efforts of this kind, we have more fully developed the scientific faculty, the exercise of this faculty in detecting scientific principles in nature, and in directing practice by theory, is no longer irksome, but becomes an unfailing source of enjoyment, to which we return so often, that at last even our careless thoughts begin to run in a scientific channel.
I quite admit that our mental energy is limited in quantity, and I know that many zealous students try to do more than is good for them. But the question about the introduction of experimental study is not entirely one of quantity.  It is to a great extent a question of distribution of energy.  Some distributions of energy, we know, are more useful than others, because they are more available for those purposes which we desire to accomplish.
Now in the case of study, a great part of our fatigue often arises, not from those mental efforts by which we obtain the mastery of the subject, but from those which are spent in recalling our wandering thoughts; and these efforts of attention would be much less fatiguing if the disturbing force of mental distraction could be removed.
This is the reason why a man whose soul is in his work always makes more progress than one whose aim is something not immediately connected with his occupation.  In the latter case the very motive of which he makes use to stimulate his flagging powers becomes the means of distracting his mind from the work before him.
There may be some mathematicians who pursue their studies entirely for their own sake.  Most men, however, think that the chief use of mathematics is found in the interpretation of nature.  Now a man who studies a piece of mathematics in order to understand some natural phenomenon which he has seen, or to calculate the best arrangement of some experiment which he means to make, is likely to meet with far less distraction of mind than if his sole aim had been to sharpen his mind for the successful practice of the Law, or to obtain a high place in the Mathematical Tripos.
I have known men, who when they were at school, never could see the good of mathematics, but who, when in after life they made this discovery, not only became eminent as scientific engineers, but made considerable progress in the study of abstract mathematics.  If our experimental course should help any of you to see the good of mathematics, it will relieve us of much anxiety, for it will not only ensure the success of your future studies, but it will make it much less likely that they will prove injurious to your health.
But why should we labour to prove the advantage of practical science to the University?  Let us rather speak of the help which the University may give to science, when men well trained in mathematics and enjoying the advantages of a well-appointed Laboratory, shall unite their efforts to carry out some experimental research which no solitary worker could attempt.
At first it is probable that our principal experimental work must be the illustration of particular branches of science, but as we go on we must add to this the study of scientific methods, the same method being sometimes illustrated by its application to researches belonging to different branches of science.
We might even imagine a course of experimental study the arrangement of which should be founded on a classification of methods, and not on that of the objects of investigation.  A combination of the two plans seems to me better than either, and while we take every opportunity of studying methods, we shall take care not to dissociate the method from the scientific research to which it is applied, and to which it owes its value.
We shall therefore arrange our lectures according to the classification of the principal natural phenomena, such as heat, electricity, magnetism and so on.
In the laboratory, on the other hand, the place of the different instruments will be determined by a classification according to methods, such as weighing and measuring, observations of time, optical and electrical methods of observation, and so on.
The determination of the experiments to be performed at a particular time must often depend upon the means we have at command, and in the case of the more elaborate experiments, this may imply a long time of preparation, during which the instruments, the methods, and the observers themselves, are being gradually fitted for their work.  When we have thus brought together the requisites, both material and intellectual, for a particular experiment, it may sometimes be desirable that before the instruments are dismounted and the observers dispersed, we should make some other experiment, requiring the same method, but dealing perhaps with an entirely different class of physical phenomena.
Our principal work, however, in the Laboratory must be to acquaint ourselves with all kinds of scientific methods, to compare them, and to estimate their value.  It will, I think, be a result worthy of our University, and more likely to be accomplished here than in any private laboratory, if, by the free and full discussion of the relative value of different scientific procedures, we succeed in forming a school of scientific criticism, and in assisting the development of the doctrine of method.
But admitting that a practical acquaintance with the methods of Physical Science is an essential part of a mathematical and scientific education, we may be asked whether we are not attributing too much importance to science altogether as part of a liberal education.
Fortunately, there is no question here whether the University should continue to be a place of liberal education, or should devote itself to preparing young men for particular professions.  Hence though some of us may, I hope, see reason to make the pursuit of science the main business of our lives, it must be one of our most constant aims to maintain a living connexion between our work and the other liberal studies of Cambridge, whether literary, philological, historical or philosophical.
There is a narrow professional spirit which may grow up among men of science, just as it does among men who practise any other special business.  But surely a University is the very place where we should be able to overcome this tendency of men to become, as it were, granulated into small worlds, which are all the more worldly for their very smallness.  We lose the advantage of having men of varied pursuits collected into one body, if we do not endeavour to imbibe some of the spirit even of those whose special branch of learning is different from our own.
It is not so long ago since any man who devoted himself to geometry, or to any science requiring continued application, was looked upon as necessarily a misanthrope, who must have abandoned all human interests, and betaken himself to abstractions so far removed from the world of life and action that he has become insensible alike to the attractions of pleasure and to the claims of duty.
In the present day, men of science are not looked upon with the same awe or with the same suspicion.  They are supposed to be in league with the material spirit of the age, and to form a kind of advanced Radical party among men of learning.
We are not here to defend literary and historical studies.  We admit that the proper study of mankind is man.  But is the student of science to be withdrawn from the study of man, or cut off from every noble feeling, so long as he lives in intellectual fellowship with men who have devoted their lives to the discovery of truth, and the results of whose enquiries have impressed themselves on the ordinary speech and way of thinking of men who never heard their names?  Or is the student of history and of man to omit from his consideration the history of the origin and diffusion of those ideas which have produced so great a difference between one age of the world and another?
It is true that the history of science is very different from the science of history.  We are not studying or attempting to study the working of those blind forces which, we are told, are operating on crowds of obscure people, shaking principalities and powers, and compelling reasonable men to bring events to pass in an order laid down by philosophers.
The men whose names are found in the history of science are not mere hypothetical constituents of a crowd, to be reasoned upon only in masses.  We recognise them as men like ourselves, and their actions and thoughts, being more free from the influence of passion, and recorded more accurately than those of other men, are all the better materials for the study of the calmer parts of human nature.
But the history of science is not restricted to the enumeration of successful investigations.  It has to tell of unsuccessful inquiries, and to explain why some of the ablest men have failed to find the key of knowledge, and how the reputation of others has only given a firmer footing to the errors into which they fell.
The history of the development, whether normal or abnormal, of ideas is of all subjects that in which we, as thinking men, take the deepest interest.  But when the action of the mind passes out of the intellectual stage, in which truth and error are the alternatives, into the more violently emotional states of anger and passion, malice and envy, fury and madness; the student of science, though he is obliged to recognise the powerful influence which these wild forces have exercised on mankind, is perhaps in some measure disqualified from pursuing the study of this part of human nature.
But then how few of us are capable of deriving profit from such studies.  We cannot enter into full sympathy with these lower phases of our nature without losing some of that antipathy to them which is our surest safeguard against a reversion to a meaner type, and we gladly return to the company of those illustrious men who by aspiring to noble ends, whether intellectual or practical, have risen above the region of storms into a clearer atmosphere, where there is no misrepresentation of opinion, nor ambiguity of expression, but where one mind comes into closest contact with another at the point where both approach nearest to the truth.
I propose to lecture during this term on Heat, and, as our facilities for experimental work are not yet fully developed, I shall endeavour to place before you the relative position and scientific connexion of the different branches of the science, rather than to discuss the details of experimental methods.
We shall begin with Thermometry, or the registration of temperatures, and Calorimetry, or the measurement of quantities of heat.  We shall then go on to Thermodynamics, which investigates the relations between the thermal properties of bodies and their other dynamical properties, in so far as these relations may be traced without any assumption as to the particular constitution of these bodies.
The principles of Thermodynamics throw great light on all the phenomena of nature, and it is probable that many valuable applications of these principles have yet to be made; but we shall have to point out the limits of this science, and to shew that many problems in nature, especially those in which the Dissipation of Energy comes into play, are not capable of solution by the principles of Thermodynamics alone, but that in order to understand them, we are obliged to form some more definite theory of the constitution of bodies.
Two theories of the constitution of bodies have struggled for victory with various fortunes since the earliest ages of speculation: one is the theory of a universal plenum, the other is that of atoms and void.
The theory of the plenum is associated with the doctrine of mathematical continuity, and its mathematical methods are those of the Differential Calculus, which is the appropriate expression of the relations of continuous quantity.
The theory of atoms and void leads us to attach more importance to the doctrines of integral numbers and definite proportions; but, in applying dynamical principles to the motion of immense numbers of atoms, the limitation of our faculties forces us to abandon the attempt to express the exact history of each atom, and to be content with estimating the average condition of a group of atoms large enough to be visible.  This method of dealing with groups of atoms, which I may call the statistical method, and which in the present state of our knowledge is the only available method of studying the properties of real bodies, involves an abandonment of strict dynamical principles, and an adoption of the mathematical methods belonging to the theory of probability.  It is probable that important results will be obtained by the application of this method, which is as yet little known and is not familiar to our minds.  If the actual history of Science had been different, and if the scientific doctrines most familiar to us had been those which must be expressed in this way, it is possible that we might have considered the existence of a certain kind of contingency a self-evident truth, and treated the doctrine of philosophical necessity as a mere sophism.
About the beginning of this century, the properties of bodies were investigated by several distinguished French mathematicians on the hypothesis that they are systems of molecules in equilibrium.  The somewhat unsatisfactory nature of the results of these investigations produced, especially in this country, a reaction in favour of the opposite method of treating bodies as if they were, so far at least as our experiments are concerned, truly continuous.  This method, in the hands of Green, Stokes, and others, has led to results, the value of which does not at all depend on what theory we adopt as to the ultimate constitution of bodies.
One very important result of the investigation of the properties of bodies on the hypothesis that they are truly continuous is that it furnishes us with a test by which we can ascertain, by experiments on a real body, to what degree of tenuity it must be reduced before it begins to give evidence that its properties are no longer the same as those of the body in mass.  Investigations of this kind, combined with a study of various phenomena of diffusion and of dissipation of energy, have recently added greatly to the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that bodies are systems of molecules in motion.
I hope to be able to lay before you in the course of the term some of the evidence for the existence of molecules, considered as individual bodies having definite properties.  The molecule, as it is presented to the scientific imagination, is a very different body from any of those with which experience has hitherto made us acquainted.
In the first place its mass, and the other constants which define its properties, are absolutely invariable; the individual molecule can neither grow nor decay, but remains unchanged amid all the changes of the bodies of which it may form a constituent.
In the second place it is not the only molecule of its kind, for there are innumerable other molecules, whose constants are not approximately, but absolutely identical with those of the first molecule, and this whether they are found on the earth, in the sun, or in the fixed stars.
By what process of evolution the philosophers of the future will attempt to account for this identity in the properties of such a multitude of bodies, each of them unchangeable in magnitude, and some of them separated from others by distances which Astronomy attempts in vain to measure, I cannot conjecture.  My mind is limited in its power of speculation, and I am forced to believe that these molecules must have been made as they are from the beginning of their existence.
I also conclude that since none of the processes of nature, during their varied action on different individual molecules, have produced, in the course of ages, the slightest difference between the properties of one molecule and those of another, the history of whose combinations has been different, we cannot ascribe either their existence or the identity of their properties to the operation of any of those causes which we call natural.
Is it true then that our scientific speculations have really penetrated beneath the visible appearance of things, which seem to be subject to generation and corruption, and reached the entrance of that world of order and perfection, which continues this day as it was created, perfect in number and measure and weight?
We may be mistaken.  No one has as yet seen or handled an individual molecule, and our molecular hypothesis may, in its turn, be supplanted by some new theory of the constitution of matter; but the idea of the existence of unnumbered individual things, all alike and all unchangeable, is one which cannot enter the human mind and remain without fruit.
But what if these molecules, indestructible as they are, turn out to be not substances themselves, but mere affections of some other substance?
According to Sir W. Thomson's theory of Vortex Atoms, the substance of which the molecule consists is a uniformly dense plenum, the properties of which are those of a perfect fluid, the molecule itself being nothing but a certain motion impressed on a portion of this fluid, and this motion is shewn, by a theorem due to Helmholtz, to be as indestructible as we believe a portion of matter to be.
If a theory of this kind is true, or even if it is conceivable, our idea of matter may have been introduced into our minds through our experience of those systems of vortices which we call bodies, but which are not substances, but motions of a substance; and yet the idea which we have thus acquired of matter, as a substance possessing inertia, may be truly applicable to that fluid of which the vortices are the motion, but of whose existence, apart from the vortical motion of some of its parts, our experience gives us no evidence whatever.
It has been asserted that metaphysical speculation is a thing of the past, and that physical science has extirpated it.  The discussion of the categories of existence, however, does not appear to be in danger of coming to an end in our time, and the exercise of speculation continues as fascinating to every fresh mind as it was in the days of Thales.
In 1911, John Wanamaker opened his flagship store in downtown Philadelphia. The twelve-story building, with its forty-five acres of floor space, was the largest of its time devoted to retail merchandising. Its central »Grand Court« had marble arches that rose 150 feet and was capped by a dome. Major physical innovations were hidden behind this visual wonder: sixty-eight state-of-the-art elevators; the latest in fireproofing; a large power plant devoted entirely to the store; and sophisticated heating, ventilating, and sanitation systems.
Wanamaker had been in the forefront of retailing for more than thirty years by the time he opened this store. His goal was to provide the elegant shopping experience of major European boutiques while satisfying the American desire for product diversity. At the same time, he based his retailing system on four fundamental principles: one price for a product (no haggling); prices guaranteed to be »10 percent lower than the lowest elsewhere«; acceptance of cash payments only, in order to keep prices low; and cash refunds or exchanges for unsatisfied customers. With these fundamental principles in hand, he became one of the leading retailers of his day.
Sixty years after the opening of Wanamaker's Philadelphia store, another entrepreneur synthesized a set of existing technologies and, along with a number of other retailers, began another revolution in the industry. Sam Walton started small in the 1970s, but Wal-Mart rapidly became the largest retailer in the United States, with total sales in fiscal year 1995 equaling the combined sales volumes of Kmart, Sears Roebuck and Co., and the supermarket chain The Kroger Co., the next three largest American retail organizations. Walton's successful innovations placed enormous pressure on other mass merchant retailers to alter their practices along similar lines. By the late 1980s, a growing number of retailers had started changing the way they did business.
As we have emphasized, the current retail revolution---involving new information technologies, new product labeling, and new methods of distribution---has driven changes in the apparel and textile industries as well. Yet this revolution didn't happen overnight; nor was it the brainchild of a single entrepreneur. In fact, the retail systems of both Wanamaker and Walton integrated a variety of innovations that had already been pioneered by other retailers. For example, Wanamaker's »one-price« policy was initially adopted by wholesaler Arthur Tappan in the 1820s and experimented with by Lord & Taylor in 1838 and Rowland Macy in the early 1850s. Similarly, bar codes and electronic scanning---key building blocks of new retailing practices---began in the grocery industry. Kmart became the first major nonfood retailer to employ them as a means of tracking inventory in the early 1980s, several years before Walton made this technology a core building block of his distribution system.
This chapter will examine the differences between the traditional re-tail model and lean retailing. We explore how the set of practices that traditional retailers drew on to merchandise and distribute products became increasingly costly. Then we return to why retailers----Wal-Mart, Kmart, J. C. Penney, Dillard's Inc., Federated Department Stores, and others---adapted technologies and management practices to handle demand uncertainty, product proliferation, and complex sourcing decisions.
Imagine the problems faced by a typical department store. It must cater to a diverse clientele: men, women, and children, with varied tastes, disparate income levels, and a wide range of physical measurements. It must deal with seasonal changes that affect the type of clothes offered---is it winter or summer? The beginning of the school year? The holiday season? If the company operates stores in different geographic regions, its product offerings must also reflect regional differences in style, weather, income, and culture. In addition to these factors, consumer tastes often shift rapidly, sometimes within a single season. These long-standing causes of variation in consumer demand have been further compounded by accelerating product proliferation in all segments of the apparel industry.
The combination of different sizes, colors, styles, fabrics, price lines, and consumer groups means that a retailer must carry an enormous range of different products. The more diverse the consumer base of the retailer, the larger the number of individual products typically measured in stockkeeping units (SKUs). This variety is portrayed in Table 3.1, which shows the number of SKUs provided annually by different types of retailers over the course of a year. The number of SKUs can range from just 10,000 for a discount food store like Costco, which offers a limited number of products sold in large quantities, to more than two million different items in an upscale department store.
Today retailers must manage this profusion of products. At an operational level, this means deciding what types and how many of any one good it should stock to maximize sales per square foot of available space---one of the most critical measures of retail performance. If all goes well, retailers allocate space to different goods efficiently, responding to shifts in consumer tastes (stocking the hits and discontinuing flops); setting pricing policies (markups and markdowns) to deal with both the direct cost of goods and the nature of consumer demand; and controlling inventory to reduce exposure to risk. Further, the contemporary retailer has to keep track of sales and inventory accurately by SKU.
The early twentieth-century success of Wanamaker's and other department stores illustrates that the keys to effective retailing are providing customers with a variety of desirable products, procuring those products at a low enough cost to make a profit, marketing them well, and charging prices that reflect customers' willingness to pay. As we discussed in the last chapter, large retailers were able to implement this strategy in the late nineteenth century because the falling distribution costs afforded by a national railway system, as well as new information links arising from the telegraph and later the telephone, provided economies of scale and scope. Other technological innovations, including steel construction, plate glass, and the Otis elevator, allowed retailers to expand multi-story floor space without purchasing more real estate, providing for a more varied collection of products. The creation of a national highway system in the 1950s further fostered the development of mass retailing by opening vast new spaces in suburban malls.
Under the traditional model, retailers ordered desired products far in advance of the selling season because their apparel suppliers charged less for large runs and long lead times with long periods of advance commitment. Retail buyers, assigned to a specific product line, purchased products based on their best guesses of what would sell. They would then apply rules of thumb to allocate volume across styles and sizes. These transactions typically occurred eight to ten months before the goods appeared on the retailer's selling floor. The success of buyers therefore turned on their ability to predict what consumers would want and to obtain those products at the lowest possible cost. Although the order would specify a delivery time far closer to the season, once the buyer placed the order with the apparel manufacturer, it typically remained unchanged until delivery to the retailer's warehouse or individual stores.
As portrayed in Figure 3.1, the typical shipment between an apparel manufacturer and retail customers was large and of low frequency---usually once a season. Once delivered, the retailer held the products in central warehouses or as inventory in individual stores' »back rooms.« When the desired time of display and sale arrived, workers stocked the product on the selling floor and replenished from store or warehouse inventories as the selling period progressed. Inventory control relied on painstaking, manual comparisons between sales records (paper receipts) and physical counts of items on the floor, in the back room, and in warehouses. Overstocks at the close of a season were then marked down for clearance, warehoused in inventory for future sales, or sold to a secondary market supplying discount retailers.
Those who could predict, or in some cases create, markets for new products clearly were at an advantage. Not surprisingly, fast tracks in the traditional retail world started with buyers, and many apparel CEOs successfully demonstrated their »feel« for the market early in their careers. This list includes John Wanamaker and Marshall Field in the early era of the department store; Stanley Marcus of Nieman Marcus and Millard S. Drexler of The Gap are more recent examples of »buyer« CEOs.
The best traditional retailers were also good at merchandising. Effective merchandising requires matching the retailer's product mix to the tastes and incomes of its targeted customers. Establishing the target customer base is therefore a critical first step in any merchandising strategy. Although this may seem obvious today, Wanamaker shook up the existing retail world in the 1870s by seeking to understand his customers' preferences as a basis for making merchandising choices.
A century later, retailing success is often attributed to combining effective marketing with an understanding of consumer tastes. The growth of private-label programs among retailers in the 1980s exemplifies this trend. In private-label programs, retailers create a distinctive product line under their exclusive name and license. If successful, a retailer's private-label program can capitalize on the same type of strong brand recognition that has yielded profits to companies like Levi Strauss or more recently Tommy Hilfiger. For example, the success of The Gap's jeans, J. C. Penney's Arizona line, and Sears's Canyon River Blue line has led to erosion of the market share held by the two leading jeans manufacturers, Levi Strauss and VF Corporation. According to Standard & Poor's, »In the 1980s the standout performers in retailing developed a sustainable competitive advantage by differentiating themselves in the eyes of the consumer....The winners have either created new markets or revitalized old businesses with a price and product mix geared toward a narrower market.«
In addition to effective buyers and merchandising, successful traditional retailers relied on a third element: purchasing products at low costs through buying power (volume or cash position), or via access to the cheapest domestic and international sources for apparel. As we've already noted, international sourcing has become increasingly prevalent. Beginning in the 1970s, retailers expanded their offshore sourcing efforts, especially after quality standards improved, establishing sourcing offices and relationships in low-wage countries, particularly in Asia.
Nevertheless, large-scale retailing came with its own risks. Through their buying power, traditional retailers could dramatically lower the direct costs of procurement and, in the process, usurp the role of wholesalers in the apparel distribution system. Purchasing in large quantities for their stores, however, subjected retailers to the attendant risk of selling »perishable« products like apparel. The absence of business systems capable of adjusting to real-time demand information, as well as the lack of information between the time when orders were placed and the actual selling season, meant that early order commitments could not be amended pending new information. In terms of the retail bottom line, this risk appeared in the indirect costs associated with holding inventories of unwanted products and stock-outs of popular items.
Two trends over the past twenty-five years have compounded the problems inherent in the traditional retail model. First, product proliferation has vastly increased the number of products retailers are required to manage in their stores. Second, the total amount of retail space in the United States has expanded dramatically, even while consumer expenditures on apparel items have declined as a share of total expenditures. Some analysts deem this »the overstoring of America.« Since the early 1980s, retailers have faced the growing costs associated with holding inventories of a wider variety of goods in a world increasingly characterized by industry overcapacity. Low-cost international suppliers helped fill the gap for a while, but the traditional retail model can no longer hold its own without information integration and other innovations.
In Chapter 1, we introduced the fashion triangle, which includes the three types of goods commonly sold by apparel retailers: fashion, fashion-basic, and basic products. Although product variety in apparel has historically been associated with the fashion end of the industry, the number of products available to U.S. consumers in almost every apparel category has grown significantly over the past two decades.
Consider men's shirts. Throughout much of the post--World War II era, the majority of men's shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts. But today a shirt manufacturer's »basic« collection typically includes solid white, blue, and a white/blue weave, as well as white with color stripes in pure cotton, cotton/polyester blends of various mixtures, and other fabrics like 100-percent cotton oxford, pinpoint oxford, and several qualities of broadcloth. Most of the collection will come with a choice of collar styles, and some will include a French cuff option. There are also common cuts (»silhouettes«), such as regular, athletic, loose fit, and long. In addition to these dimensions, there are quarterly collections of different fabrics. Each shirt corresponding to a combination of these characteristics---for example, a 16--35 blue, button-down, pinpoint oxford shirt with French cuffs cut long---has its own pattern of demand that varies considerably over the course of a year.
For a retailer, a larger number of SKUs raises the level of uncertainty regarding what product will sell or not sell in any period. In practical terms, this means that a retailer carrying a broader array of goods faces increased costs both for carrying goods in inventory that will not sell (overstocks) and running out of a good that sells beyond expectations (stock-outs). The costs associated with demand uncertainty, which were previously connected primarily with fashion products---that is, the problem of selling a highly perishable item---have grown enormously for apparel retailers. Apparel retailers are not alone: The variety of products offered has increased considerably in most consumer product sectors, from most segments of the retail food industry to home building products to personal computers.
Increasing product proliferation was clear among the business units in our survey, as vividly portrayed in Figure 3.2. The average number of SKUs per business unit rose from an average of 3,871 in 1988 to 6,304 in 1992. This overall increase is mirrored by growth in the average number of new SKUs introduced per year by apparel business units, which increased from 2,368 in 1988 to 3,688 in 1992. Meanwhile, the number of discontinued SKUs rose from 2,057 to 3,050. This means that a large portion of each apparel firm's product line consists of new products. The consequent »churning« of products adds further uncertainty to the retailer's or manufacturer's already difficult tasks.
Construction of retail centers, particularly shopping malls, boomed in the 1980s. Rapid expansion of retail space arose from a simple formula that had traditionally proven successful: Add more stores and revenue growth will follow. The early age of retailing was marked by the expansion of stores within major metropolitan areas, but in the early 1960s, retailers started flocking to large, enclosed suburban malls and non-enclosed »strip malls.« As a result, between 1972 and 1992 the annual rate of new shopping-center construction outpaced the growth in population and potential consumers. The size of retail establishments also grew during this period because of two important trends. First, the number of independent department stores---usually a single-site enterprise of relatively moderate size---declined dramatically in the 1980s. Second, many multi-enterprise retailers either built large new stores or expanded the size of existing ones.
Far outpacing the overall growth in population, retail space per capita rose from 5.3 square feet per person in 1964 to 9 square feet in 1974 to 16 square feet in 1988. By 1996, it had grown still further, reaching close to 19 square feet. In comparison, per capita retail space in a developing country like Mexico is estimated at .3 square feet.
The growth in consumer expenditures did not rise commensurately with the boom in retail space. The apparel and upkeep share of household expenditures in the Consumer Price Index fell from 10.6 percent in 1963 to 5.5 percent in 1995. Per capita expenditure for apparel and related services declined from $1,710 in 1992 to $1,698 in 1994 (in current dollars). And these downward expenditure trends occurred in the face of growth in the average number of outerwear garments consumed per capita: from 14.3 garments in 1967 to 28.7 garments in 1995. In other words, the amount of money spent by an average consumer per garment fell over this period, reflecting in part more casual workplaces, which allow people to spend less on clothing for work, and intense price competition. Retailers with more and more floor space were chasing fewer and fewer apparel-consumption dollars.
Increasing product proliferation, retail overcapacity, falling relative per capita expenditures on apparel, and the constant pressure to provide lower prices to consumers created an unforgiving competitive environment for retailers. Overall margins for the industry (particularly for specific retail segments like department stores) declined between 1977 and 1987. By the mid-1980s, a number of the most prestigious retailers were faltering, with some filing for bankruptcy or being acquired by other retailers.
Department stores proved to be one of the most adversely affected retail sectors. Their inability to adapt to changing consumer tastes and the emergence of new retail channels that targeted specific consumer segments---specialty stores (especially so-called »category killers«), catalog stores, and mass merchants---led to erosion in market share. Although in the 1960s and 1970s the majority of apparel sales occurred in department stores, by 1990 they accounted for only 29 percent of all sales. Venerable giants like Macy's, Gimbels, Saks Fifth Avenue, Federated, and Wanamaker filed for bankruptcy in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Product proliferation coupled with industry overcapacity revealed the costs inherent in the traditional model of retailing. Three types of costs were particularly high under the old model: forced markdowns to clear out unsold goods; lost sales from stock-outs; and the costs asso-ciated with holding inventory. In 1985, the losses associated with -markdowns, stock-outs, and inventory carrying costs for U.S. retail-apparel-textile channels were estimated to be $25 billion. An estimated 56 percent of these losses, $14 billion, arose from the need to mark down unsold products, either through store sales and promotions or through the use of the sizable secondary market for items purchased by discount retailers for sale to other consumer segments. Product stock-outs accounted for 24 percent, $6 billion, of the losses, and the cost of inventory carrying itself constituted the remaining 20 percent, $5 billion.
Price reductions from the beginning to the end of the season also increased dramatically over the period from 1948 to 1988, one in which there was considerable growth in product proliferation. Consequently, the difference between early season and end-of-season prices for women's apparel from the late 1960s to 1988 grew substantially. Although these losses were borne throughout the entire channel to some extent, a disproportionate share, 65 percent, fell on retailers. This is not surprising, given the traditional retailing strategy under which retailers commit to purchases well in advance of the selling season.
Despite its high costs and negative impact on the bottom line, being left with unwanted apparel products---or running out of fashion hits---was viewed by most traditional retailers as a cost of doing business. With neither timely information on the state of sales at the store, nor the capability to use that information, little could be done to resolve this source of uncertainty and excess cost in the channel. This historical constraint only began to change with the advent of the current retail revolution.
The whole point is speed and clarity of communications. With this new technology, buying procedures that used to take weeks have now been cut to days---and sometimes even hours. That has greatly enhanced our response to new trends, reduced turnaround times and increased the flexibility of all those involved in the buying process.
---William Howell, Chairman, J.C. Penney, 1995
If lack of information provided a regrettable but unavoidable cost of doing business in retailing before the late 1980s, access to information has become crucial to competitive success in the 1990s. The ability to gather, transmit, and use information regarding sales at the cash register has created a new way of offering products to customers. It has created the lean retailer.
The leveraged buyouts, mergers, and corporate restructuring of the 1980s left many of the historic retail powerhouses in a vulnerable condition, with a number of the strongest traditional retailers---Macy's, Saks, Sears---in an extremely weakened state. But this industry landscape also left the field open for the emergence of a new kind of retail competitor, one able to harness information as a central component of its competitive strategy.
A number of retailers filled this role, becoming the vanguard of the lean retailing revolution. Lean retailing represents an amalgam of technologies and management practices adopted and refined by various companies. Although no single retailer pioneered or adopted all the innovations that compose lean retailing, we focus here on those in three segments---mass merchants, national chains, and departments stores---that played important roles in initiating the larger transformation.
Wal-Mart is the most well known of the early lean retailers. Traditional mass merchants sought cost advantage through economies of purchasing scale. Given limited information on sales, this meant that these retailers purchased large inventories of goods that they would then »push« to consumers, often by means of price reductions and sales promotions. Beginning in the late 1970s, Wal-Mart sought to reduce its costs by using emerging information technologies to track consumer sales at the checkout counter, monitor its inventory of goods within and across stores, and then supply its stores on an ongoing basis via highly efficient, centralized distribution methods. By capitalizing on »real-time« information on sales and inventory position, Wal-Mart increased its ability to let consumer demand »pull« its orders. As a result, it could reduce the amount of inventory it needed to hold for any given product and focus its resources on stocking those goods that were being purchased by consumers.
The Wal-Mart strategy required and fostered the development of a company-wide computer system to track incoming and outgoing shipments to the various stores. Through the use of its own proprietary standard, Wal-Mart gathered and exchanged information among its stores, distribution centers, and the main office in Bentonville, Arkansas, to monitor sales, place orders based on those sales, track shipments to the distribution centers, and coordinate the flow of materials and information throughout the system. By the early 1980s, the company's investments in this information system---including satellite links to handle its immense amount of daily data---totaled more than $700 million.
Wal-Mart reaped the full benefits arising from its extensive information systems when it shifted its focus from internal purposes to a means of interacting with suppliers. In 1987, Wal-Mart began its first major experiment in changing its relationship with a key supplier, Procter & Gamble, by establishing the »Wal-Mart Retail Link« program. This program provided Procter & Gamble with access to Wal-Mart's point-of-sales information, allowing the supplier to track sales of its products on a real-time basis and manage its inventory accordingly. In the words of Lou Pritchett, Procter & Gamble's vice president of sales at the time, »P&G could monitor Wal-Mart's inventory and data and then use that information to make its own production and shipping plans with a great deal more efficiency. We broke new ground by using information technology to manage our business together, instead of just to audit it.«
The Wal-Mart/Procter & Gamble partnership has been often cited by the business press. The program began through an informal discussion between Sam Walton and Procter & Gamble's Pritchett. Although the effort has been characterized as a partnership, senior executives at Procter & Gamble have also noted that the initial impetus came from Walton. The partnership required Wal-Mart to switch from its internal proprietary standard to a more widely adopted electronic data interchange (EDI) standard, as well as to bar codes that were already in use by other retailers, particularly Kmart. Although Kmart was the first major retailer to experiment with EDI, Wal-Mart led the way in structuring supply relationships and its overall competitive strategy around information exchange. The program soon expanded to other vendors, including apparel suppliers, who entered their own »trading partnerships« with Wal-Mart. Thus, what began as a system focused on efficient distribution eventually evolved into the modern system of lean retailing.
J. C. Penney built an internal data communications network well in advance of its use with suppliers. Point-of-sale terminals first appeared at its stores in the mid-1970s, allowing the company to capture information on store-level sales. Penney was also one of the first retailers to adopt scanner technologies. Although early forays into electronic data management relied on mainframe computers, between 1988 and 1991 the company installed 45,000 cash registers equipped with microprocessors and storage capabilities.
These store-level investments were accompanied by major capital investments in central computer processing capacities, continuing development of store- and corporate-level software systems, and improvements in distribution operations. In the late 1980s, Penney drew on these systems to allow corporate buyers in its Plano, Texas, headquarters to display potential products to geographically dispersed individual store merchandisers who, with store managers, had considerable autonomy within the company. This information infrastructure proved most beneficial when it gave Penney's major vendors access to sales data via direct broadcast satellite. There was initial resistance, however. Despite the company's offer to provide suppliers with EDI downloads, many declined because of their inability to process the data. It was only when Penney provided aggregated reports via fax to account executives that a thousand vendors agreed. By 1993, Penney was using EDI for processing 97 percent of purchase orders and 85 percent of invoices with 3,400 of its 4,000 suppliers. Nonetheless, many small suppliers did not have electronic links with the company.
It is no accident that such innovative information and distribution relationships with key suppliers emerged through Wal-Mart, Kmart, and a national chain like J. C. Penney rather than among department or specialty stores. The larger size of these mass merchants facilitated adoption of rapid-replenishment practices as a result of economies of scale in inbound and outbound transportation, information technology, and distribution center operations. Indeed, the adoption of these distribution innovations parallels the emergence of department stores and mail-order houses a century earlier.
Both mass merchants and national chains cover a more narrow range of products---primarily basic apparel items---than department stores. Basic products are prime candidates for lean retailing because such a product style remains in a retailer and apparel company's product line over much of the selling season and often over several years. That makes it easier to use information acquired during the selling season for replenishment during the same season or for forecasting future demand. Basic items also represent a major percentage of all apparel goods sold. In our 1992 HCTAR sample, 45 percent of all shipments by business units, weighted by sales volume, could be classified as basic. Therefore, given their scale and product mix, it is not surprising that Wal-Mart, Kmart, and J. C. Penney were among the early pioneers of lean retailing.
Department Stores: Dillard's and Federated
Although providing consumers with low prices for a limited range of goods underpins the strategy of mass merchants and national chains, department stores (going back to Wanamaker) rely on offering consumers a diverse and exciting collection of goods. The focus of department stores tends to be on the middle and higher portion of the fashion triangle; consequently, lean retailing came later to this segment of the industry.
Dillard's was a pioneer in the use of information technology for tracking and responding to sales. Dillard's became one of the first department stores in the late 1980s to build a centralized inventory-tracking system to provide its headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, with real-time information on sales, by both store and item. This entailed buying and then adapting early scanning technologies for use at sales counters and for point-of-sale data collection. Dillard's also purchased computing capacity for individual stores and its headquarters office, along with the necessary equipment to connect stores to the head office via electronic data transmission.
With these systems in place, it began to develop distribution centers capable of being efficient intermediaries between its suppliers and stores. Finally, like the mass merchants and national chains, Dillard's started insisting that its suppliers invest in corresponding technologies to allow electronic reordering and to meet its increasingly stringent service requirements. But unlike a mass merchant that typically manages over 125,000 separate items in a large store, the Dillard's system uses this information to manage over one million SKUs in one of its flagship stores.
Federated originated as a decentralized »federation« of well-known stores like Rich's and Bloomingdale's, with wide variation in both its merchandising and back-room activities. Like Dillard's, its stores carry a vast array of products: a typical department store may have 800,000 items; its flagship Macy's in midtown Manhattan offers more than two million separate SKUs. During the 1980s, however, the amount of inventory held by Federated ballooned while it faced bankruptcy.
Under CEO Alan Questrom, the company addressed these problems by attempting to increase its inventory turns (the number of times a year that goods turned over in its stores) and reduce its exposure to losses from excess inventories. This entailed instituting aggressive markdown policies in the short term to remove large inventories that had built up in many divisions and stores. At the same time, the company began to redesign its logistics system---the method it used to move goods from suppliers, through warehouses, and to delivery at stores.
The size of Federated's logistics challenge can be captured by the following figures. In 1997, the company moved over 700 million units from its suppliers to its stores, requiring an average of 500 truck deliveries per day, which amounted to thirty million miles for deliveries per year. Like Dillard's, J. C. Penney, and others, Federated spent millions of dollars on installing scanners, adopting bar codes and EDI to communicate internally and with suppliers. Given the size of its logistics challenge, Federated also chose to redesign its methods of moving goods from suppliers to stores. With the establishment of an independent operating unit, Federated Logistics, this retailer reduced the amount of time required to process merchandise in distribution centers by 60 percent, to an average of two days.
Meanwhile, the company sought to maintain the strengths of its divisions---Macy's and Bloomingdale's, in particular---in merchandising. It created, among other innovations, a »team buying« system that centralizes certain buying functions to benefit from potential economies of scale while taking full advantage of divisional expertise regarding different customer groups within Federated's stores. Yet a tension exists between its desire to provide customers with a changing variety of apparel fashions and the need to increase its capacity to replenish a higher percentage of products, thereby taking advantage of its expertise in logistics. Increasingly, a department store must be successful at both pursuits. We discuss the trade-off arising from providing new products with little information on consumer demand (fashion products) and replenishing items on the basis of sales (historically limited to more basic products) in detail in Chapter 6.
Although Wal-Mart's rapid climb has created the most sound and fury, a variety of retailers adopted and adapted different pieces of lean retailing in the early 1990s. Note that the push toward rapid replenishment, reduction of lead times, and what has often been called »quick response« came predominately from retailers rather than from their apparel suppliers.
The next chapter analyzes the building blocks of lean retailing, drawing on the retailers described above as well as others. Chapter 5 discusses how the retail revolution has led to a tremendous shift in bargaining power within the channel---away from manufacturers and suppliers and toward lean retailers.
In this chapter, I take up dilemmas that today's parents face in rearing young children. Throughout this book, we have touched on myriad forces that make contemporary parenting highly challenging. These include one-sided, contradictory messages in the parenting-advice literature; career pressures that impinge on parent involvement in children's lives; abysmally weak American child-care services to assist employed parents in their child-rearing roles; cultural violence and excessive materialism permeating children's worlds; schools with less than optimal conditions for children's learning; and impediments to granting children with deficits and disabilities social experiences that maximize their development.
Contemporary parents do not just find child rearing more difficult; they feel more uncertainty than their predecessors about whether and how to intervene in their children's activities and behavior. In the pages that follow, I draw on major themes of this book---the power of adult warmth, appropriate expectations, narrative conversation, make-believe play, and teaching in the »zone«---to show how Vygotsky's sociocultural approach can serve as a guide for resolving a great many child-rearing concerns.
This chapter answers twenty questions drawn from a survey of over four hundred parents of 2- to 8-year-olds living in a Midwestern city with a population of one hundred thousand. In that survey, I asked parents to list any questions about young children's development and learning that interested or worried them. The questions I answer here address issues that appeared most often in parents' responses. Each represents a concern that surfaced in three or more parental replies.
I intend these answers to parents' questions to reflect a way of thinking about child rearing, not a set of recipes for dealing with specific events. When parents are familiar with principles that are grounded in contemporary theory and research on children's development, they can better deal with the quandaries generated by the changing home, school, and community contexts in which today's children grow up. Although adverse cultural trends have complicated and threatened good child rearing, parents---as agents of change, buffers against stressful life circumstances, and gatekeepers of learning opportunities---can do much to protect, restore, and reshape children's experiences.
My 7-year-old doesn't think very well of himself. Is poor self-esteem a major cause of learning problems? How can I increase my child's self-esteem? Should I be praising him more?
When we speak of self-esteem, we refer to the judgments we make of our own worth and the feelings associated with those judgments. People with high self-esteem, although recognizing their limitations, are fundamentally satisfied with their characteristics and competencies. Their self-confidence, self-respect, and realistic appraisal of their current skills fortify them in the face of failure, motivating them to try hard to surmount challenges.
By the school years, individual differences in self-esteem are clearly evident and strongly related to children's everyday behaviors. That is, most school-age children are quite good at judging their own strengths and limitations. For example, children who agree with such statements as, »I'm good at schoolwork,« tend to achieve well academically; children who concur that »most kids like me« get along well with their classmates; and children who say that they're »usually the one chosen for games« are more advanced in physical skills.1 Many parents sense this strong link between children's self-esteem and accomplishment. Consequently, they may try to build their child's self-esteem with praise and reassuring comments.
Although self-esteem and favorable development are related, high self-esteem does not necessarily cause effortful behavior and achievement. Rather, to help sustain good outcomes, self-esteem must be earned through commitment, responsibility, and mastery of meaningful skills.2 Children whose parents combine warmth with reasonable expectations for mature behavior feel especially good about themselves.3 Warm parenting lets children know that adults believe they can succeed. And firm but appropriate expectations prompt children to strive for attainable goals and to use those goals as reasonable standards against which to evaluate their behavior.
Parents who deliver praise not based on real attainment actually undermine their child's development. It does not take long for most children to see through these false compliments and to question their self-worth. For others, this unconditional parental acceptance may contribute to an unrealistic, overly inflated sense of self-esteem, which is also linked to adjustment problems. In one study, second and third graders identified by their teachers as frequently teasing, starting fights with, and excluding other children were far more likely than their classmates to rate themselves as perfect on a self-esteem questionnaire.4 Their distorted view of their own competence appeared to undermine any motivation to improve their social behavior.
Just as parents can't solve a child's motivational and self-esteem difficulties through indiscriminate praise, they also can't do so through critical, impatient remarks or harsh, forceful tactics, as in »You're lazy!« »Why don't you try hard like your sister!« »Do that homework or you'll be punished!« These strategies spark anger and resentment in children and undermine a positive parent--child relationship, on which motivation and effort thrive. And they destroy self-esteem by conveying a sense of inadequacy to children---that their behavior needs to be controlled by adults because they are unable to manage it themselves.
Instead, parents can foster high but realistic self-esteem by asking themselves three crucial questions:
- Are the demands I make of my child within his or her »zone«---neither too high nor too low?
- Have I forged a warm parent--child relationship so my child is fueled with the desire to meet my expectations?
- Have I used firm but encouraging tactics---scaffolding of academic tasks to promote autonomous mastery; narrative conversation about the importance of trying hard to convey strong work-ethic values; and joint participation in routines and duties, such as meal preparation and household chores, to assist in developing responsibility?
Finally, children don't need to feel great about everything they try. None of us is adept in every area. Rather, during the school years, self-esteem differentiates into an array of self-evaluations. For example, children judge themselves to be good at some school subjects and physical skills but not so good at others. Eventually, they combine these separate self-evaluations into a general appraisal---an overall sense of self-esteem. It remains positive so long as the child feels that he or she is competent at some worthwhile skills.5
In sum, the route to favorable self-esteem lies in parents' encouragement of achievement and responsibility. Then children have something worth feeling good about. Praise should be tied to real progress and attainment. Encouraging words are particularly helpful when children are trying their best but gains in performance are hard won. And most children greatly appreciate a parent's congratulations for a job well done. Positive self-judgments formed in these ways foster continued effort and mastery, which in turn promote high self-esteem.
How much television and what kinds of programs should I permit my preschool child to watch?
The typical preschool child devotes nearly 13 percent of his or her waking hours to watching television, a figure that rises to 30 percent by school age. Clearly today's children spend far too many hours in front of the TV set, a circumstance that restricts time available for joint parent--child activities, play, reading, and other worthwhile pursuits. Television is so pervasive an influence in children's lives that I discussed it at length in Chapter 2.
Parents are wise to limit children's access to TV to about one to one-and-a-half hours a day---no more than 10 hours a week. Following that guideline would cut the exorbitant number of hours children spend watching TV by 50 to 75 percent. Parents also need to prohibit violent TV and orient children toward educational programs that inform them about their world and toward entertainment shows that teach positive values and social skills. In Chapter 2, I explained how readily children can pick up negative attitudes and behaviors from television. Fortunately, children can just as easily absorb worthwhile messages and information from TV, so parental guidance in this area can have great benefits for development.
In Chapter 2, I also noted that it is crucial for parents to model good viewing practices; to watch TV with children, helping them understand and evaluate what they see; and to use televised content as inspiration for make-believe play and other enriching activities. Another suggestion: Try not to use television to reward or punish children. This increases its attractiveness, making children want to watch all the more.
My 20-month-old daughter and husband enjoy going to the Public Broadcasting System website. I'm delighted that they spend time together, but the whole computer concept makes me nervous. Already, my daughter bangs on the keys and uses the mouse. How much is too much and how young is too young?
More than half of American families own a personal computer, and one-third of these have access to the Internet---rates that are growing rapidly.6 It's not surprising that even very young children are attracted to the computer---often more so than to television. As one school-age child commented, »It's fun because you can control it. TV controls itself.«7 Your key-banging, mouse-clicking 20-month-old already seems to appreciate this sense of electronic control!
As I noted in Chapter 4, the computer, like TV, has just as much potential for good as for ill. Hence it's another alluring device that requires close parental monitoring and intervention---to prevent children from becoming addictive users; from immersing themselves in violent, gender-stereotyped video games; and from accessing websites and web pages with sexual, aggressive, or other inappropriate content.
Undoubtedly, father and daughter are benefiting greatly from their time together at the computer. The warmth, exploration, conversation, and fun involved in this and other joint parent--child activities strengthen emotional bonds and foster both cognitive and social development. But such an early introduction to the computer is not necessary. Young children orient to computers because they frequently see adults using these stimulating devices, so they want to do so, too.
Almost all American public-school classrooms have at least one computer, and many preschools have them as well. But for the computer to enhance learning in early childhood, adults must guide children in its constructive use and help them acquire computer-literacy skills. Around 3 years of age, children can type in simple commands and play educational games. Although they like the computer, most preschoolers do not find it so captivating that it diverts them from other worthwhile activities.
A common parental worry is that computers will channel children into solitary pursuits and disrupt their social development. To the contrary, children generally prefer to use computers socially. At home, they often like to engage in computer activities with a parent or older sibling because they can do much more with the help of an expert partner. And at school, small groups often gather around the machine to solve problems collaboratively.
How can parents capitalize on the computer's potential for spurring their child's development? A variety of educational software is available that permits children to practice academic skills and acquire new knowledge through discovery learning, reasoning, and problem solving. As soon as children begin to read and write, they can use the computer for word processing. It permits them to write freely without having to struggle with handwriting, and they can plan and revise their work easily. As a result, young writers worry less about making mistakes, and their written products are longer and of higher quality. However, computers by themselves do not help children master the mechanics of writing, such as spelling and grammar. Consequently, they are best used to build on, not replace, other writing experiences.
Beginning in the late preschool years, children can learn to program. Specially designed computer languages, such as LOGO, are available for this purpose. As long as adults provide the necessary scaffold, children benefit greatly from programming experiences. They not only acquire a valuable new skill but master new concepts, become better problem solvers, and think more creatively. Also, since children must detect errors in their programs to get them to work, programming helps them reflect on their thinking and regulate their own behavior.
How much is too much and how young is too young? There's no evidence that computer experiences make toddlers more skilled computer users or thinkers. By kindergarten and primary school, children can gain much from computer activities. As far as how much computer time parents should permit, the answer depends on what children are doing. When they are involved in writing, problem solving, or other educational pursuits, there's no special reason to be very restrictive. But not all software called »educational« is the same quality, so parents are wise to evaluate what their children are learning. Moreover, parents must ensure that time at the computer does not interfere with the variety of experiences children need to learn at their best. And playing violent video games and freely accessing the Internet should be prohibited.
How many and what kinds of toys does a young child need? My 3-year-old son is attracted to guns and war toys. How should I handle this type of play?
Martha Bronson's The Right Stuff for Children Birth to 813 is as an excellent resource for selecting play materials that provide children of varying ages with both pleasure and an appropriate challenge. On pages 138 to 141 of Chapter 4, I provided an overview of play-material suggestions for stimulating make-believe and game play in children between 2 and 8 years of age. In Bronson's book, you'll find additional recommendations, organized into four broad play-activity categories: social and fantasy play; exploration and cognitive mastery; music, art, and movement; and gross motor play.
Children's rooms and play spaces need not be filled with every toy imaginable. A modest number of toys is sufficient. Children who have too much typically care little for what they have. When given a chance to acquire something new, they usually don't react with much excitement or selectivity. For materially indulged children, new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in. The child comes to think, if I don't like what I just got, I can always discard it for something else. A bedroom or playroom heaped high with a jumble of toys, many broken and mistreated, also teaches children that possessions need not be cared for and respected.
Parents often assume that the play materials children choose are the ones that are best for their development. To some degree, this assumption makes sense: If a toy isn't appealing to the child, the child isn't going to spend time with it. So it's important to provide children with a variety of play materials responsive to their interests.
Nevertheless, preference is not the same as appropriateness. Children sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them. Other toys should not be given to children because they encourage undesirable play behaviors. Guns and other forms of weaponry fall into this category. In Chapter 4, I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both make-believe and real hostility in children's interactions with peers.
When thinking about purchasing a new toy for your child, ask yourself these questions:
- Does my child already have too many toys, and am I adding to this overabundance?
- Is the toy responsive to my child's interests, and is it likely to sustain his or her involvement over time?
- Do I want my child to acquire the values and skills the toy teaches?
- How will the toy help provide a foundation for my child's future learning and development?
I'm expecting a new baby. How much is too much information for a 4-year-old about pregnancy and childbirth?
It's easy to tell preschool and young school-age children too much about pregnancy and childbirth---more than they are capable of understanding. The best approach is to respond to their questions with simple, direct answers. The younger the preschooler, the less likely he or she is to notice the pregnant mother's growing tummy and to be interested in how the baby got in there. Such questions as, »Where do babies come from?« »Where did I come from?« and »How does a baby get born?« rarely occur before age 5.
When children do ask these questions, parents vary widely in how much information they are comfortable in providing. Up to age 8 or 9, most children are satisfied with such general explanations as it »starts as a little seed inside the mother, which grows into a baby,« »grows in a special space in the mother's tummy called a uterus,« and »when the baby's ready to be born, the mother's uterus squeezes and squeezes, and the baby comes out.« Some parents show their child books with pictures of fetuses, identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the baby's development as it progresses. There's no evidence that this is in any way harmful or that it's necessary during early childhood; rather, it's a matter of parental choice.
Eight- to 9-year-olds are ready for more detailed knowledge about how babies are conceived and grow, as children of this age are getting closer to puberty. A variety of well-written and illustrated books are available to help parents discuss love between partners, conception, birth, and rearing of children. Parents need to select carefully, making sure they agree with the book's values. Two books that I like are How Babies Are Made, by Andrew Audrey and Steven Schep, and Where Did I Come From? by Peter Mayle. How I Was Adopted, by Joanna Cole, is an excellent starting point for discussion with preschool and young school-age children who are adopted.
I don't believe in spanking. We do time outs, which seem to work for our 4-year-old. How long is time out effective, and what's the next step?
Although spanking has declined over the past 50 years, the majority of parents in the United States admit to slapping or hitting their child for misbehaving. There is good reason not to believe in spanking. A great deal of research shows that it promotes only temporary compliance, not lasting changes in children's behavior. Children who are repeatedly criticized, shouted at, and slapped are likely to display the unacceptable response again as soon as adults are out of sight and they can get away with it. In fact, children of harshly punishing parents develop into especially disobedient and aggressive youngsters. In a study of a national sample of over twelve hundred mothers of 6- to 9-year-olds, psychologists Murray Straus, David Sugarman, and Jean Giles-Sims found that the more spanking the mothers reported, the more antisocial behavior their children displayed two years later---cheating, telling lies, being mean to classmates, and disobeying teachers.
Why doesn't spanking work? First, when parents spank, they often do so in response to children's defiance and aggression. Yet the punishment itself models aggression! Second, children who are frequently punished soon learn to avoid the punishing adult. When children evade their parents, they reduce parents' opportunity to teach desirable behaviors. Finally, as spanking »works« to stop children's misbehavior temporarily, it offers immediate relief to parents, which rewards them for spanking. For this reason, the parent is likely to spank with greater frequency and intensity over time, a course of action that can spiral into serious abuse.
This does not mean that parents should never express anger at or punish a child. An otherwise warm parent who is disappointed and disapproving lets the child know that the transgression is serious. When children realize that adults regard their misdeed as very important, they listen more closely. And punishment is warranted after repeated infractions.
But parents have far better ways to punish than spanking. One of these is time out---requiring a child to sit aside or to go to his or her room. Another is withdrawal of privileges, such as a visit to the playground or a weekly allowance. These mild punishments derive their potency from warm parent--child bonds. Children of involved, caring parents find the interruption in parental affection that accompanies punishment to be very unpleasant. As a result, they want to regain the warmth and approval of the parent as quickly as possible.
An important preventive of misbehavior---and a vital element of effective punishment---is explanation. Pairing reasons with mild punishment (such as time out) leads to a far greater reduction in rule violations than using punishment alone. The reason the adult gives the child must match the child's capacity to understand. At ages 2 to 3, referring to simple, direct outcomes works best, as in, »If you keep pushing Tommy, he'll fall down and cry.« By age 4, parents can give more complex and subtle explanations. For example, they can refer to others' intentions (»Don't yell at Jessica. She was only trying to help«), to others' feelings (»He's proud of his tower, and you knocked it down; now he's very sad«), and to issues of rights and fairness (»That toy belongs to Rudy, so you must ask for a turn«).
Explaining to children what they did wrong, why it was wrong, and how they should have acted helps them recall the misdeed and relate it to expectations for future behavior. Furthermore, by pointing out the impact of the child's actions on others, parents prompt children to feel empathy and sympathy---emotions that motivate concern for others. And giving children reasons for changing their behavior invites them to judge the appropriateness of parents' expectations---to see that parents are not being arbitrary or autocratic. Explanations lead children to strive to meet parental standards because those standards make sense.
In sum, when time out is combined with reasoning, it remains effective through the school years. You can tell that your approach to discipline is working when time out and other punishments become less necessary as your child shifts from externally controlled responses to behavior based on inner standards and compassion for others. Typically this shift is well under way between ages 4 and 7.
If parents find themselves punishing frequently, then they need to reconsider the basis of their discipline. When sensitivity, cooperation, and exchanges of affection are evident in parent--child interaction, children as young as 2 years of age more often follow parental directives. Children with an affectionate, mutually gratifying parental tie want to heed parents' demands because they feel a sense of commitment to the relationship. This reduces the need for punishment, freeing parents to focus on encouraging children's competent behavior.
Three additional ways to avoid excessive punishment are worth mentioning. First, changing aspects of the environment can reduce children's problematic behavior. One parent arranged for her younger child to play at a friend's house during his sister's birthday party, realizing that the boy wasn't yet ready to join in the party's activities and would likely disrupt them. Second, a close look at the reasonableness of the rules can be helpful. Another parent caught herself before yelling, »Don't roll down that hill!« at her daughter. She realized that the child was unlikely to hurt herself on the gentle, grassy slope and that any grass-stained clothing could easily be washed. With a moment of reflection, the parent backed off from an almost-delivered rebuke to allow a pleasurable play activity. Finally, sensitivity to children's physical and emotional resources helps prevent inappropriate punishment. When children are tired, ill, or bored, they are likely to engage in attention-getting, disorganized, or otherwise improper behavior as a reaction to discomfort rather than as an affront to authority. In these instances, meeting the child's needs makes more sense than punishing.
What's the best way to deal with repeated tantrums in a 3-year-old child who gets so enraged that he hits and throws things at you? How can you calm a preschooler when the situation requires him to listen and pay attention?
When a tantrum occurs, time out is useful---transferring the child to an unstimulating area where he can't throw things until the emotional storm is over. If he tries to throw anything or to hit you, you need to prevent him from doing so, gently but firmly. It's crucial to remain calm and to avoid harsh, coercive tactics, which will only fuel the child's rage and poor emotional control.
It's also important to figure out why these persistent tantrums are occurring. As the often-heard phrase »terrible twos« suggests, many people assume that tantrums are a fact of life for 2- and even 3-year-olds. Once toddlers acquire the ability to follow adult directives, one way they assert their autonomy is by resisting parents' requests and demands, using the familiar refrain, »No!« And from time to time, toddlers lose control. When frustrated, they haven't yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions. But parents who take mental notes for a day on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their child''s tantrums really are. For most young children, eager, willing cooperation is much more common than opposition.
If your child has been emotionally reactive and difficult to soothe since infancy, then temperament is probably a significant contributor to his behavior. You'll also want to consider whether any changes in your family or the child's daily life might be sparking intense anxiety---marital conflict, divorce or remarriage, a new baby brother or sister, starting preschool or child care, or a parent going to work when the child is used to having him or her at home. Parenting practices can modify children's temperaments and assist them in coping with stressful life events. Protection from family discord; extra parental warmth, affection, and pleasurable time together when the child is behaving well; and firm, calm, and consistent discipline will help.
Most children build up to a tantrum gradually. Parents can tell it's in the offing, and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak. For example, if the child is about to »blow« while you're out shopping, try involving the child in the shopping experience---pointing out things of interest to the child; asking the child to help you select and carry purchases; and reminding the child that after the shopping is finished, you are going to do something the child enjoys. When parents interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the child's attention, they provide strategies children can use on their own to regulate emotion. If parents always wait to intervene after the child has become intensely distressed, it's harder not only for the parent to calm the child but for the child to learn to calm down. And once the child regains emotional control, reassuring the child of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parent--child relationship and strengthens the child's sense of security.
Make-believe play is an effective context in which preschoolers can practice what to do when frustrated. Parent and child can take turns acting out the »parent« and »child« roles. While playing the »child,« the parent can get upset. Then parent and child can come up with ways to help the »child« control intense feelings. Occasionally during make-believe, children send parents clear messages about disciplinary tactics they want and need to quell tantrums. In one instance, Sonja, a mother at wit's end over her 4-year-old daughter Meredith's frequent fits of kicking and screaming, consulted a child psychologist. The psychologist had Meredith play the »mother« and Sonja play the »child.«
When the »child« asked for a cookie, the »mother« said, »No cookies before dinner. You can have a cookie after dinner.«
Sonja the »child« began to mimic her daughter's tantrums. »I want a cookie. I want two cookies! Gimme my cookies!« she shouted.
»No!« Meredith the »mother« answered, »No cookies until after dinner.«
»I want cookies now!« Sonja the »child« wailed while thrashing about in Meredith's usual fashion.
Meredith looked on, dismayed by her mother's unruly behavior. Then she stepped out of the play and instructed, »You're supposed to say, 'No cookies until later,' Mommy.«
When Sonja the »child« continued her screaming and crying, Meredith stated more insistently, »Mommy, say, 'No cookies! You can't have cookies before dinner!'«
With the psychologist's help, Sonja reflected on the play episode, realizing that she'd been inconsistent in handling Meredith's outbursts, sometimes resisting, at other times giving in. As a result, Meredith continued the tantrums to get her way, yet she desperately wanted to stop these explosions and to follow sensible, consistent rules. To do so, she needed her mother to send a clear, rational, and steadfast message that tantrums are inappropriate and ineffectual and that cookies are eaten after dinner.
What suggestions do you have for disciplining a strong-willed, stubborn child? Nothing seems to work, including time out and loss of privileges.
As this question makes clear, some children are far harder to discipline than others. A child's temperament affects the ease with which he or she will follow parental directives and listen to explanations. In Chapter 5, I indicated that the impulsivity and emotional reactivity of children with ADHD make them very hard to rear and often lead to strife-ridden adult--child relationships, which further reduce children's cooperation. Willful, stubborn children are also challenging to discipline. They tend to evoke harsh punishment, which heightens their resistance.
A seemingly stubborn child may feel so little anxiety that parental disapproval and mild punishment do not spark enough inner discomfort to motivate compliance. Consequently, parents of headstrong children must use firm, consistent discipline and repeatedly explain how to behave and why. At the same time, such parents must resist the temptation to engage in carping criticism, harshness, and force. A warm parent--child bond based on cooperation is especially vital for helping recalcitrant children internalize parents' standards. It provides the obstinate youngster, who feels little or no anxiety when reprimanded, with an alternative foundation for meeting parents' expectations: a desire to preserve a spirit of affection and harmony with the parent.
Because parents' communication with noncompliant children is often riddled with negativity, it can take time to get the relationship on a better track. Arranging regular times for joint parent--child pleasurable activities is vital. Making sure to notice and praise the child's favorable behavior also reduces the negative cloud hanging over parent--child interaction.
Finally, looking for the »silver lining« in the child's difficult disposition can help parents muster the fortitude needed to rear a child with a difficult disposition. Consider Carl, one of the most obstinate participants in a study of the combined impact that temperament and child rearing have on long-term development. Beginning in infancy, Carl rejected many routines and experiences, including baths, bedtime, and new foods. He shrieked, cried, and struggled to get away. Yet his parents regarded his emotional intensity as a sign of inner strength and vigor. They believed that if they were patient and firmly insistent, Carl would, in the end, adapt positively.
By the time Carl reached school age, he was doing remarkably well. The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively. He did well in school and became enthusiastically involved in several activities. One of these was playing the piano---lessons that he had asked for but (in his typical fashion) at first disliked intensely. Carl's mother had granted his request for piano instruction under one condition: that he stick to the lessons for six months. She held him to this agreement despite his protests, which gradually subsided. Carl came to love his introduction to music. His parents' warmth, determination, and consistency had helped him gain control of his behavior and benefit from new learning opportunities.
How can you get an inactive child who loves quiet play to be more active and sociable?
Parents of quiet children often wonder whether their youngster is developing normally. Preschoolers whose play and behavior are typically mature for their age but who prefer solitary, tranquil activities are probably doing just fine, both cognitively and socially. As I indicated in Chapter 3, only certain kinds of nonsocial activity---aimless wandering; immature, repetitive motor action; and anxious hovering around peers without joining in their play---are cause for concern. Most play of quiet preschoolers is not of this kind. Instead, it is positive and constructive, consisting of such activities as art, make-believe play, puzzles, and block-building.
Our society places such a high value on sociability that adults often regard quiet reserve as a sign of maladjustment. Yet not all cultures see things this way. Chinese adults, for example, view quiet children very positively---as advanced in social maturity. Thai primary-school teachers also value restrained, persistent child behavior, and they regard children who would be average in activity level in the United States as poorly behaved and unmotivated. Equating an energetic pace and gregariousness with normality is a Western cultural phenomenon---one that does not match what we know about quiet, nonanxious children. Most are bright youngsters with intense interests who, when they do play with peers, show socially skilled behavior.
Nevertheless, you might want to encourage a quiet, inactive child to engage in active play from time to time---to ensure healthy exercise and to broaden the child's experiences. The best way to do this is to join the child in active games, such as tag, relay races, hide-and-seek, and throwing and catching. Creating a »zone« for learning---by ensuring that active play is fun, provides plenty of opportunity to practice physical skills, and is not overstimulating for the quiet child---will increase the success of these efforts. You won't be able to transform a quiet child into a physical dynamo, but you can help the child learn to enjoy moderate physical activity. Finally, parents of quiet children may be gratified to learn that a calm, less active nature typically makes a child easier to rear.
How does a parent gain respect from a child who sees the other parent acting disrespectfully toward his or her spouse?
Children learn much about how to relate to others by observing their parents' day-to-day communication. Marital conflict is linked to hostile behavior and poor emotional adjustment in children, including feeling sad and engaging in aggressive acts. Hearing one or both parents berate the other leads children to act similarly---toward parents, siblings, teachers, and peers. If disrespect between parents includes physical harm, then children's difficulties can escalate further.
Besides modeling destructive forms of interaction, parents who behave hurtfully toward each other generally interact hostilely with their children. They also tend to use inconsistent discipline---alternately strict and lax. When parents scold children on some occasions but permit them to act inappropriately on others, children are confused about how to behave and engage in especially high rates of disobedience.
In sum, parents behaving insolently to each other are up against a brick wall in getting a child to behave respectfully. They need to repair their relationship. Seeking the help of a marriage and family counselor without delay is the best way to prevent the child's emotionally despondent and angry reactions from spiraling into lasting adjustment problems.
Any tips on raising an only child?
The best way for parents to ensure that only children fare well is to engage them in development-enhancing dialogues, to impose reasonable expectations for mature behavior, and to discipline effectively. Overall, parents of only children are quite successful in attaining these child-rearing goals. Contrary to popular belief, only children are not destined to become spoiled and selfish. Instead, research consistently shows that they are as well adjusted and as socially competent as other children. And they form just as close and as rewarding friendships as do children with siblings, suggesting that they can and do learn to share and to be considerate of others' needs. Furthermore, only children have a more positive sense of self-esteem and do better in school than do children growing up in families with two or more children.
A major reason for these positive outcomes is that having just one child generally means a closer parent--child relationship; more time for high-quality parent--child interaction; and greater encouragement for mastery and accomplishment. But because only children lose the lifelong benefits of positive sibling ties, parents might take steps to enrich the child's life with sibling-like relationships---for example, by cultivating warm bonds with cousins or the children of close family friends. In sum, with good parenting, only children fare extremely well.
How can you keep a child's self-esteem high while still praising a sibling's achievements and good behavior? When a child »acts out« because of sibling jealousy, what's the best way to handle it?
Children display wide individual differences in the quality of their sibling ties. Once again, temperament makes a difference. For example, arguments between siblings increase when one child is emotionally intense and highly active. But parents can do much to foster favorable sibling interaction. During the preschool years, mothers tend to be more positive and playful with second-borns than first-borns, and they discipline the older child more. This differential treatment is understandable, in that older children are more competent and capable, so parents expect more. But being older also means more privileges---for example, being able to stay overnight at a friend's house or enroll in certain after-school activities and lessons. These advantages may help compensate for an older child's perception that a younger sibling is receiving better treatment.
If parents experience intensifying sibling conflict, they may want to reevaluate their communication with each child. Warmth and frequent expressions of affection are associated with positive sibling interaction, whereas harshness and coldness are associated with sibling antagonism. Once established, this link between parent--child and sibling relationships is self-perpetuating. Warm parenting fosters considerate sibling interaction, which prompts positive parental communication in the future. When parents are hostile and coercive, children act similarly toward their siblings, and parental anger escalates.
The elementary school years are a time when sibling conflict can increase. As children get feedback about how well they are doing in school and in other activities (such as sports and music lessons), parents may compare their accomplishments, especially when siblings are close in age and the same gender. The child who feels less valued is likely to resent a sibling whom parents seem to prefer. Therefore, when praising one child, parents should try not to diminish the merits of another. If a sibling expresses jealousy, parents can remind the envious child of an admirable personal trait or a recent commendable performance. But be careful not to give empty praise (not based on real accomplishment), which children quickly come to mistrust. It may fuel jealousy of a sibling, whom the child concludes parents really appreciate.
In sum, parents can foster positive sibling ties through expressing warmth and affection, stressing each child's positive qualities and achievements, and refraining from making comparisons. When sibling relationships are friendly and sympathetic, they bring many benefits, including gratifying companionship, emotional support, and assistance with everyday tasks.
Should you try to curb bossy behavior when siblings or peers are playing together? If so, at what age?
Yes, you should step in and teach alternative, cooperative modes of interaction---at as early an age as you observe bossiness. A child who has trouble engaging in give and take during play with siblings or peers will quickly become embroiled in conflict.
As I noted in Chapter 4, pleasurable, rewarding play depends on attaining intersubjectivity, or shared understanding. Children must resolve differences of opinion and find ways to meet both their own needs and those of their playmates. When domineering, uncooperative behavior is extreme, the bossy child is likely to be rejected by agemates. Long-term peer rejection, as I indicated in Chapter 5, not only leads to an unhappy social life but to serious adjustment problems in adolescence and early adulthood.
When a child uses bossy tactics, interrupt the play and ask the child to think of a better way to get others to cooperate, such as making requests and taking into account the playmate's preferences. If the child can't think of alternatives, suggest and model several. If bossiness continues unabated, insist that the child leave the play area, explaining why he or she must do so. During times when you're alone with the child, talk about problems that have arisen in peer and sibling play and help the child think of good social problem-solving strategies. Then act out these situations in make-believe, granting the child plenty of practice in applying effective social skills and showing the child how others are likely to react if bossy behavior returns.
How can a parent identify the difference between a language disorder and normal language development? What resources are available?
If your child's language development is delayed by several months when compared to norms for early language milestones, then your child might have a language disorder. But keep in mind that children vary greatly in their pace of language learning. For example, girls are slightly ahead of boys in early vocabulary growth, and reserved, cautious children often wait until they understand a great deal before trying to speak. When they finally do speak, their vocabularies grow rapidly.
Here is a summary of major language milestones for the first 2 years:
Because of wide individual differences, it's sometimes hard to tell a language disorder from normal variation in language development. If you're concerned about your child's language progress, consult a trained speech--language pathologist. The American Speech--Language--Hearing Association (ASHA) maintains a list of certified speech--language pathologists for referrals.
The most common cause of early language problems is a hearing loss. Typically, children with hearing impairments are not identified until 12 to 25 months of age, when speech and language development is already delayed. Therefore, ASHA recommends that all newborn babies be screened for hearing disorders before they leave the hospital. Newborn testing takes only a few minutes and permits problems to be addressed early, preventing negative consequences for all aspects of psychological development.
Hearing loss can also emerge later. The most common cause during toddlerhood and the preschool years is repeated otitis media, or middle ear infection. Some episodes are painful, so parents detect them, but many are accompanied by few or no symptoms. Children with recurrent otitis media bouts have trouble making out what others are saying. Hence they are distractible, behind in language progress, and socially isolated; and they also achieve poorly in school.
When children begin preschool or child care, they are more susceptible to otitis media because of close contact with other children. Therefore, frequent screening for the disease, followed by prompt medical intervention, is vital. Interestingly, verbally stimulating adult--child interaction and high-quality child care help reduce developmental problems associated with otitis media. When adults converse often with children and keep environmental noise to a minimum, children with persistent ear infections have more opportunities to hear and respond to spoken language.
I'm trying to decide whether to enroll my 5-year-old son in kindergarten or wait until next year. How can I tell if he's ready for kindergarten? If he doesn't do well in kindergarten, should he repeat it or go into a »transition« class?
Many parents struggle with the decision of whether to enroll their child in kindergarten once the child meets the age requirements. Most often, they consider delaying the start of school for boys, who as a group tend to lag behind girls in cognitive and social development. At the heart of parents' concern is whether their child will be able to meet the academic and social demands of the kindergarten classroom.
Although many teachers believe that a 5-year-old who's on the young side can benefit from waiting another year before enrolling in kindergarten and advise parents to hold the child out, research has not revealed any advantages for delayed entry. A host of studies indicate that younger children make just as much progress, academically and socially, as do older children enrolled in the same grade. No difference exists between younger and older classmates in achievement test scores.
A related dilemma involves whether to retain a kindergartner for a second kindergarten year if he or she is not progressing well. More than a half-century of research has failed to show any learning benefits for children retained in grade, and mounting evidence indicates that retention can be harmful, prompting negative attitudes toward school and a drop in self-esteem and in academic motivation, even as early as kindergarten. In one study, retained kindergarten children, despite the extra year of school, scored lower than their classmates in academic achievement after entering the primary grades. In contrast, children recommended for retention but who nevertheless went on to first grade were doing just as well as classmates who had been promoted in the standard fashion.
Yet another alternative is to place a poorly performing kindergarten child in a »transition« class---a waystation between kindergarten and first grade. Transition classes, however, are a form of homogeneous grouping that gathers children judged by the school system as less likely to succeed. As with other »low-ability« groups, teachers often have lower expectations for transition-class students and teach them in a less stimulating fashion than they do other children.
Notice that each of the options just mentioned assumes that readiness is inherent in the child---that a 5-year-old must have reached a certain level of development to profit from classroom experiences. Consider, once again, the concept of the »zone,« in which teaching leads development. It tells us that children don't just grow into school readiness. Rather, they acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for successfully participating in classroom life through the assistance of others. This means that readiness is not something we must wait for. Instead, we can cultivate it. Parents, teachers, and school systems can work together to ensure that each child takes the next appropriate steps toward mastering the range of capabilities needed for school success.
The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) recommends that every child of legal age start kindergarten. It also recommends against school readiness testing as a means for deciding whether a child should be admitted to kindergarten, be retained in kindergarten, or enroll in a »transition« class rather than a first-grade class after completing kindergarten. School readiness tests are poor predictors of children's future school performance and identify many children as unready who are quite ready to handle school experiences.
As long as teachers are sensitive to children's diversity and work with small groups and individual children within their »zones,« there is no reason to hold a child out of kindergarten. Deciding not to enroll a child and opting for an alternative experience is justifiable only when the kindergarten environment is so rigid and unaccommodating to individual differences that the child would be frustrated and unhappy and would have an unproductive year.
My first grader has homework to do several times a week. Should I help her with her homework, and if so, how should I do so?
American parents often express uncertainty about helping their child with homework. They worry that by providing help, they will discourage self-reliance in thinking and problem solving. Vygotsky's concept of the »zone« underscores that children acquire the many capacities they need to learn autonomously from the assistance of parents, teachers, and other more expert adults. By collaborating with the child on a challenging task, the adult assesses what the child can already do and what the child is ready to learn, providing a support system for mastery.
The metaphor of a scaffold, discussed in Chapter 2, is an excellent guide for how to help your child with homework. Scaffolding involves varying your assistance to fit the child's changing competence. When the child says, »I don't understand,« you can adjust the task, breaking it into smaller parts. You can also provide prompts, hints, and explanations, increasing the amount and directiveness of your guidance until the child makes progress. As you do so, you can assist the child in analyzing why certain problem-solving approaches work and others do not, encouraging her to come up with ideas for surmounting difficulties. As she starts to apply the strategies derived from your dialogue, you can reduce the intensity of your intervention, letting her take over responsibility for the task.
Too often, parents imagine that their child's classmates can do the homework assignment independently. After all, they say to themselves, why would the teacher have assigned it if this weren't so? This pattern of reasoning leads parents down a counterproductive path. »What's wrong with my child?« they say to themselves. »She should be able to do the assignment, just like everyone else!« But recall that children of the same age differ widely in their »zones.« And rooted in the very idea of the »zone« is that learning requires teaching! Children in our culture frequently are rebuked for seeking help, a response that promotes dependency, helplessness, and retreat from challenge, not competence and autonomy.
Chinese and Japanese parents spend a great deal of time helping their children with homework---far more than American parents do. Asian parents also communicate often with teachers about how to help their child learn at his or her best. Rather than being dependent, Chinese and Japanese students develop into well adjusted, excellent students---at the top in academic achievement in the world.
When does math become a greater problem for girls than for boys? What can be done to help girls do well in math?
Throughout elementary school, girls get better grades in math---and other academic subjects---than do boys. At times, school-age boys outperform girls on math achievement tests, but boys' advantage in math isn't clearly evident until secondary school. A close look at children's performance on specific test items reveals that both genders do equally well in basic math knowledge, and girls do better in computational skills. Boys' advantage appears on tests of math reasoning, primarily on complex word problems and in geometry.
The cause of boys' late-appearing math advantage is a matter of controversy. Some experts believe the difference is rooted in boys' superior ability to reason about spatial relations. Gender differences in spatial skills are present by elementary school and persist throughout life. Young people who are good at spatial reasoning are, indeed, better at solving complex math problems. One conjecture is that male (androgen) hormones may play some role in enhancing boys' spatial skills. But evidence favoring this idea is inconsistent.
Although heredity may contribute to boys' spatial superiority, experience also makes a difference. Children who engage in manipulative activities involving spatial relations, such as block play, model building, and carpentry, do better on spatial reasoning tasks. Also, playing video games that require rapid mental rotation of visual images enhances the spatial test scores of boys and girls alike. Yet boys spend far more time at all these pursuits than do girls.
Furthermore, children's and adolescents' attitudes toward math and their belief in their capacity to do well at it affect their math achievement. Boys feel more confident about their math ability, even when their grades are poorer than girls'. Why might this be so?
Shortly after entering primary school, children regard math as a boys' subject---a stereotype that prompts girls to like math less than boys do. Girls also predict poorer math performances for themselves than boys predict for themselves. Children derive these views from their social surroundings. They listen to what parents and teachers say about who is »good at math,« and they see more men in math-related careers---from math teachers in the upper school grades to scientists in the wider community.
Also, subtle feedback from adults undermines girls' confidence in their ability to do well at math. If a parent or teacher believes that a child is not very capable at a school subject, the adult may act surprised when the child succeeds, ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this: »Gee, you did a lot better than I expected!« And when the child fails, the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability: »You're not very good at that, are you?« Girls get much more of this type of feedback than do boys, especially in math. In contrast, parents and teachers often attribute boys' poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation. »If only you'd listen and try,« they say, »you'd do much better.«
As a result of these messages, too many girls come to believe that when they succeed at math, their ability didn't help them. And after failure, they reason that weak ability, not insufficient effort, was at fault. Children who hold these discouraging explanations for their performance often come apart with anxiety when a task is difficult. They say to themselves, »I can't do this! It's too hard!« before they have really tried. Although eventually young people figure out that effort can compensate for low ability, girls may conclude that mastering complex math is not worth the cost---extremely high effort. So in high school, they retreat from advanced math courses and math-related careers.
Fortunately, parents can do much to foster girls' self-confidence and achievement in math. Beginning in the preschool years, they can provide girls with toys and activities that promote spatial reasoning and scaffold their mastery of those tasks. And they can assist children of both genders in interpreting their math successes as due to both effort and ability, in understanding that ability accrues from trying hard, and in taking failure as a sign that more effort and better problem-solving strategies are needed.
A positive sign is that the gap between boys' and girls' math achievement is declining. In addition, more girls are enrolling in advanced math and science courses in high school, and slowly but steadily, women are entering male-dominated math-related professions. The more parents hold nonstereotyped values about what males and females can and should do, the more likely girls are to sustain their high elementary-school math and science achievement in secondary school.
Why do boys lag behind girls in reading and writing in primary school? Do they catch up later?
Throughout the school years, girls attain higher scores on reading and writing achievement tests and account for a lower percentage of children referred for remedial reading instruction. Part of the reason for girls' advantage in literacy development is that they undergo a faster rate of physical maturation, believed to promote slightly earlier development of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex, where language functions are housed for most people. In addition, many types of developmental problems are more common among boys, including speech and language disorders, reading disabilities, and inattention and hyperactivity. Boys' and girls' differing genetic makeups probably underlie these gender differences, which affect reading and writing performance.
By secondary school, girls' advantage on tests of general verbal ability is so slight that it is not really meaningful. Consequently, boys who are free of reading disabilities have the potential to achieve just as well as girls in reading and writing. Still, girls continue to outperform boys in these subjects. Home and school experiences contribute, although less is known about them than those that underlie boys' advantage in mathematics.
Just as children think of math as a masculine subject, they regard reading and writing as feminine subjects. Parents rate daughters as more capable at reading than they rate sons---beliefs that children adopt. Furthermore, traditional primary-school classrooms, in which teacher-directed, whole-class lessons are the major activity, require children to sit still and concentrate for long periods of time on academic tasks that often are irrelevant to their interests. In previous chapters, I indicated that such classrooms are poorly suited to the learning needs of both boys and girls. But boys adapt especially poorly to the regimentation of traditional classrooms because of their generally shorter attention spans, higher activity levels, and less compliant dispositions.Consequently, they often are targets of teacher disapproval, which sparks negative attitudes toward school and dampens their enthusiasm for learning.
In a recent Australian study carried out by psychologist Freda Briggs, several hundred schoolchildren were asked for their views on school and classroom activities. Many boys between 5 and 9 years of age expressed dissatisfaction with school and said that their favorite activities were recess and lunchtime. But in four classrooms, distinguished by an activity-center curriculum offering opportunities for individual choice, small-group work, and literacy experiences responsive to children's interests, boys reported strong liking for school. And they named reading and writing as their favorite activities. They particularly enjoyed making their own books, based on themes of sports and hobbies.
Although more evidence is needed to be sure, perhaps classrooms that create »zones« for learning, with many of the features I described in Chapter 6, spark sufficient enthusiasm for literacy pursuits among boys that they reduce the well-known gender gap in reading and writing achievement. Finally, the trend for boys to learn to read more slowly than girls is less pronounced in countries where reading is not stereotyped as feminine but regarded as well suited to the masculine gender role.
Is learning and development affected if the father becomes less involved or absent after a divorce?
Divorce is invariably painful for children, and learning and development can be affected---temporarily and long term. Preschool and young school-age children are often profoundly upset. Because they have great difficulty grasping the reasons for their parents' divorce, they may blame themselves and take the marital breakup as a sign that they could be abandoned by both parents. As a result, they may cry and cling, refuse to go to school, and show a drop in enthusiasm for play and learning. Young children need extra affection and reassurance along with gentle reminders that their parents' separation is permanent. Of all age groups, preschoolers are most likely to have trouble accepting the reality of divorce and to fantasize that their parents will get back together.
Many school-age children and adolescents also react strongly to the end of their parents' marriage, particularly when family conflict is high and parent involvement with children is low. Around the time of divorce and for up to several years after, children tend to be emotionally volatile, displaying both depression and demandingness, noncompliance, and aggression. Boys in mother-custody families seem to have the hardest time. Research reveals that before the marital breakup, many sons of divorcing couples were impulsive and defiant---traits that may have contributed to as well as been caused by their parents' marital problems. Thus, boys often enter the period of family turmoil surrounding divorce with behavior problems and a reduced capacity to cope with stress. Custodial mothers tend to have difficulty handling sons on their own. Both boys and girls show declines in academic achievement during the aftermath of divorce, but school problems are greater for boys.
Most children improve in adjustment by two years after divorce. Yet for some, emotional distress and poor school performance persist, contributing to lasting problems into adolescence and young adulthood. Adults whose parents divorced during their childhoods tend to do less well in terms of educational, vocational, and economic attainment than their counterparts from stable families. Regardless of whether fathers remain salient figures in children's lives, the strongest predictor of good outcomes following divorce is effective parenting---combining warmth with reasonable maturity demands, limiting family conflict, and using consistent, nonpunitive discipline. Fathers who remain involved and who use good child-rearing techniques contribute greatly to the psychological well-being of children of both genders, with boys showing special benefits.
I have a child with physical disabilities (cerebral palsy) but who's very smart. Will his intellectual growth continue as long as it's promoted?
Your child's intellectual growth will definitely continue as long as you and other important adults in his life promote it. Chapter 5 of this book is devoted to the development of children with deficits and disabilities. Although I don't discuss children with cerebral palsy specifically, the same general principles for fostering continued learning in all children apply to your child. Children---with and without disabilities---acquire new competencies through dialogues with more expert partners, who are sensitive to what the child is ready to master and foster it in culturally meaningful activities.
All too often, children's disabilities are viewed as entirely biological, much like an incurable disease. Vygotsky's theory emphasizes that the most serious consequence of a physical or mental defect is not the biological impairment itself but the disruption it causes in the child's social relationships. You can help your child compensate for his physical limitations through social contact and communication aimed at strengthening the higher thought processes---voluntary attention, deliberate memory, concept formation, logical reasoning, problem solving, and imagination. »The mightiness of the mind,« Vygotsky wrote, »has virtually no limits.«
When cerebral palsy results in speech, hearing, or visual impairments, promoting language proficiency through alternative means is crucial for enhancing development. Parents and teachers who maximize children's communicative capabilities, through sign language, finger spelling, special computer technology, and other symbolic innovations, grant them access to the minds of others and to tools for collaborating with more capable partners in their »zones«---sure routes to realizing their potential.
A specter is haunting Europe,« Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote in 1848, as the first sentence of The Communist Manifesto. The specter they had in mind eventually became a political movement that came to dominate nearly half the world in the twentieth century. Behind this movement, however, lay an even more powerful idea that Marx had inspired---a Marxist conception of reality. The marketplace of economic relationships is not what it seems to be. Workers enter into seemingly voluntary contracts with employers, but underlying this system of apparent cooperation is a vast system of exploitation. Those who hold capital reap profits off the backs of those whom they hire as their laborers. This generates a dynamic of history that should, according to the theory, eventually produce a revolution by the exploited class of laborers. This theory failed to recognize the just contribution of capital in generating the opportunity to work, and the political incarnation of Marxism turned out to be historically more transient than expected. Nonetheless, the insight remains with us that relationships of employment---indeed all forms of relationship---require more than nominal consent to be legitimate. Behind the appearance of voluntary interaction there lurks the ever-present possibility of unjust exploitation.
The Marxist challenge was but the beginning of a continuing critique of the idea of freedom, so revered at the close of the eighteenth century. Behind the nominal appearance of freedom lies a structure of influence, a set of conditions that influences people to make the choices they do. Sometimes these influences are morally desirable. Peer group and family pressure can lead people to finish their university degree or to stay in difficult marriages or to remain loyal when tempted to act in self-interest. Looking back, individuals who make these choices under social influence are often grateful for the external inducement to do the right thing. Yet, economic and social conditions can also lead people to enter into socially and economically oppressive relationships, abusive marriages, and postures of dependence on drugs and alcohol. They can be induced to undress and prostrate themselves on stages in front of booths with one-way windows. The fact that people are influenced by others or their economic and emotional needs is, in itself, morally neutral, but the results can vary widely.
This is the paradox of freedom in modern times. We still believe that freedom is the great contribution of American democracy to the culture of the West. »Freedom« was our rallying cry in the decades-long battle against the political enemy that Ronald Reagan labeled the »evil empire.« Although Martin Luther King, Jr. dreamed of a society committed to the proposition that would realize the American vision of equality under law, the word that would sound from the mountaintops would not be »equality« but »freedom.« »Let freedom ring,« King reminds us in the memorable refrain of his dream. In his choice of words, King harks back to Lincoln, who recognized our commitment to the proposition that all men are created equal but hoped that the emancipation would generate »a new birth of freedom.«
We may be willing to die in the name of freedom, but we can no longer pretend that we live in the uncomplicated moral world of the eighteenth century. In a post-Marxist world, we know that freedom requires more than the experience of choosing. We cannot escape our recognition that nominal freedom leads, sometimes, to exploitation and oppression.
The late eighteenth century was indeed a marvelously simplistic time. Adam Smith could write, in the same year as the Declaration of Independence, of the wonders of a free market, based on the voluntary cooperation of producers and consumers, and its invisible hand that would produce the maximum possible welfare for humankind. Immanuel Kant could glorify freedom in his theory of law, published in 1795, a theory based on the absolute right to enter into any contract that one chooses to make. And, of course, the great monuments to the eighteenth-century understanding of freedom are the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These documents are revered because they are designed to protect the individual sphere of freedom from a presumptively aggressive and overreaching central government. The basic freedoms protected in the first Ten Amendments, ratified in 1791, include freedom of speech and the press, freedom of religion, the right to bear arms, the right to privacy against state intrusion in one's home and papers, and a plethora of rights designed to protect suspects of crime against the federal government's power to investigate and prosecute. All of these freedoms or rights are understood to be a matter of opposition of the individual against the government. They imagine a dyadic conception of government---the individual pitted against the state.
The significant feature of our basic freedoms---apart from the franchise and those that arise in the criminal process---is that we can imagine enjoying all of them in a state of nature. We do not need government in order to exercise our freedom of speech or religion, to bear arms or to be free of state intrusion in our homes. As these rights are formulated, government acquires the image of the interloper, the enemy, the potential violator of our freedom to do as we please.
And who do we fear will invade and intrude upon our island of freedom? At the time of the revolution, the fear was directed toward King George III and his colonial governors. In the newly established Republic, the fear was redirected toward the federal government. This dyadic opposition between individual and state underlies most constitutional thinking to this day. The fear of the federal government has grown into distrust toward all government. According to the official doctrine, the Bill of Rights only applies to limit »state action« encroaching upon individual liberty. As Akhil Amar recently formulated the idea, officials of the state are likely to act for their own benefit rather than the benefit of its citizens. Therefore, we must be eternally watchful against overreaching by the state. The purpose of the Constitution is to arm us with the legal means to check the tendency of the state---federal government and indeed all forms of government---to limit our natural freedom.
But there is another model of thinking that recognizes the paradox of freedom. If freedom can generate exploitation, then the task of the state should be to intervene to protect the individual against the exploitation by other private individuals. The paradigm of the exploitative, oppressive relationship in the American experience is, of course, slavery, and therefore in 1865, as the first task of the new constitutional order, we banned the very possibility of private relationships of slavery, established either by force or by consensual agreement between master and slave. The Thirteenth Amendment charges the federal government with the responsibility to make sure that neither »slavery« nor »involuntary servitude« shall come to exist in the United States. The amendment does not say that the state may not create relationships of subordination or slavery. It says simply that these private relationships, however they might come about, »shall not exist.« The important point about this formulation is not merely that it dispenses with the requirement of »state action.« It does that and more.
The Thirteenth Amendment betokens an entirely new way of thinking about government---not as an ever-threatening enemy, but as a necessary partner in the building of a society free of interpersonal exploitation. The focus of the Thirteenth Amendment is not on the potential evils of government but on the wrongs committed by private parties. Unjust private relationships do not cease existing just because one declares them not to exist. They can arise spontaneously, and in a state of nature some people would inevitably come to dominate others. The passive voice of »Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist« means that the government must be ever watchful, lest relationships of exploitation come into being.
The new function of government departs radically from the dyadic structure---the individual pitted against the state---underlying the Bill of Rights. The relationship of government to private individuals becomes triadic or three-cornered. The relationship arises between two private parties: slave owner and slave, dominator and subordinate, aggressor and victim. The third pole is the government, which must intervene to insure that the incipient relationship of »involuntary servitude« shall not exist.
A triadic relationship between two people and the government represents an entirely new kind of constitutional order. A dyadic focus takes the government to be the enemy. The triadic orientation accepts the government as a partner in conquering evil. The dyadic picture assumes that the desired form of liberty exists in a state of nature and it treats the transition to government as a threat to liberty. The triadic conception recognizes the evil of domination inherent in a state of nature and treats government not only as necessary to rid us of that evil but as a welcome partner in the effort to build a civilized society.
This difference in the attitude toward government parallels a different understanding of freedom and how it comes into being. The freedom celebrated by the Bill of Rights resembles an island of solitude, a retreat from society. Its ideal is the individual in the state of nature, intimated by Henry David Thoreau's retreat to Walden Pond. The individual stands alone, fearful that a far-off agent called government will aggress against him and limit his freedom. But the liberty that comes to the fore in the intended postbellum constitutional order and under the Secret Constitution requires the intervention of government. Liberty is born in the state's assertion of responsibility to oversee and prevent relationships of oppression. The relationship between rights and freedom is thus turned on its head. Those who identify with the Bill of Rights and the mentality of 1791 think of both rights and freedom as islands of autonomy protected by the walls of the law against the threat of government. The view that comes to the fore in the Secret Constitution recognizes that freedom as well as rights depend on the proper interaction with government. Government is not the enemy of freedom but rather the mechanism by which freedom is secured in a society that tends toward domination and oppression.
The assertion of a triadic conception of government brought us into line with the middle European conception of freedom as the privilege that arises from living in a matrix of protective state regulations. It is not nature but the law that makes us free. Freedom is realized not by the state's absence but from the construction of a network of laws that liberate the individual from the oppression that would otherwise occur. Compulsory temperance and drug laws generate freedom for those who are able to stay clean. Prohibitions against sexual self-degradation and peep shows strengthen the inner freedom of our human selves.
This is the European conception of constitutional freedom. When the German Basic Law of 1949 declares human dignity to be the foundational value of the constitution, the implications run through all relationships that may come into being. This »third-party effect« means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other, precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or, during Prohibition, not to sell each other alcoholic beverages. Today, men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job, even though in this case the »third-party« effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislation.
An activist tripartite conception of government requires funding. Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time. The war drove up spending from the customary 2 percent of the gross national product to 15 percent. (By comparison, in the early 1990s, government spending represented 20 percent of the GNP.) With no place left to turn, a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in 1862. By 1865, the income tax generated over 20 percent of federal revenue, the balance coming from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxes.
The Civil War income tax lapsed in 1872, and when the direct tax against income returned to the national agenda in the 1890s, the times were different. The disputes took on the tones of class struggle. This time, it was the Democrats who favored the tax as a measure of social justice. Many of the wealthy who were affected by the modest 2 percent tax denounced the measure as socialist. Almost immediately after the tax's introduction, a challenge under the original Constitution made its way to the Supreme Court, where five of the nine justices were convinced that any form of income tax violated the prohibition against direct taxes not in proportion to the census.6 Progressive politics as well as the government's demand for revenue generated a coalition that supported a constitutional amendment to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court. By 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment found the necessary three-fourths vote for ratification, and the income tax became a basic tool of modern state finance.
The origin of the income tax in the Civil War has largely symbolic meaning. It testifies to the government's beginning to conceive of itself as an aggressive agent charged not only with winning a total war against states in insurrection but also with taking charge of the postbellum constitutional order that would be based on different premises from the social order of freedom and fear of government.
In the second founding of the United States, thirty-seven states constituted themselves as a single nation »conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.« The government would assume the task of supervising relationships in the commercial and private spheres to assay whether they were impermissible relationships of domination---relationships morally equivalent to »involuntary servitude.« The government was newly envisioned as a triadic structure powered by an activist, well-financed government. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not clearly get the message.
The tension between two conceptions of government---bipartite and tripartite---came to a head in a classic decision of the Supreme Court in 1905. The State of New York had enacted legislation designed to protect workers in the bakery trade. Among other provisions, the legislation limited the permissible hours of work to ten per day and sixty per week. The legislation was based rather clearly on the assumption that employees are at a serious bargaining disadvantage and cannot protect their interests adequately simply by negotiating the number of hours they want to work. The state was reaching out to the worker, motivated by compassion for those who lacked the bargaining leverage to limit their hours of employment.
The defendant, Lochner, was prosecuted under a provision of the statute that made it a misdemeanor to employ someone in excess of the limit. The Supreme Court concluded by a large majority that the statute violated the liberty of the employer and presumably of the employees as well---although the latter were not complaining about being prohibited from working too many hours. A majority of five on the Court read the notion of liberty in the due process clause (»no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law«) as including freedom of contract. The dyadic structure prevailed. A similar analysis in the Peep Show case would have led to the conclusion that the women and their employers had the right to contract any form of self-exhibition they thought desirable. Any other result supposedly implies paternalism. Autonomy (if not dignity) requires freedom of contract as a basic right.
The alternative view of the case, winning support from four justices, including Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and John Marshall Harlan, was that limiting hours of employment was a legitimate way for the state to exercise its responsibility to protect the health of those who chose to work as bakers. The dissent, written by Justice Harlan, explicitly addressed the problem of unequal bargaining power between owners and bakers:
It may be that the statute had its origin, in part, in the belief that employers and employees in such establishments were not upon an equal footing, and that the necessities of the latter often compelled them to submit to such exactions as unduly taxed their strength.
Justice Holmes had the same point in mind when he wrote, apodictically, »The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics.« In other words, the principles of the free market economy need not be entrenched as a dimension of constitutionally protected liberty.
Lochner ranks among the more widely scorned decisions of the Supreme Court. The general complaint is that the Court ignored the interest of the state in furthering the health and welfare of its citizens. To put this objection in other terms, the opinion ignored the ascendancy of the tripartite conception of government. The issue remains with us---if only in a slightly different guise. Since the late 1930s, the principle of freedom of contract has given way to the propriety of the state and federal measures to protect working people on the job. Yet, the question of liberty and its potential abuse in an oppressive relationship remains a flash point of debate. Although the concept is not mentioned in the Constitution, the freedom to say »yes« or »no« to particular commercial relationships has become an essential dimension of personhood. It is as much a part of the basic liberty protected under the due process clause as the right to be free from unjustified physical restraint.
Freedom of contract enables individuals to express their personhood, but it also facilitates relationships of oppression, including »slavery and involuntary servitude.« After all, it is possible to choose to enter into a contract of slavery. The book of Exodus permits the purchase of a Hebrew slave, but after six years of service »he shall go out free, for nothing.« Yet, there are people, the Bible recognizes, who prefer the condition of servitude:
And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master. I will not go out free, then his master shall bring him to the door or to the door post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him Forever.
In this example, the servant chooses the condition of servitude. We know from the fate of many long-term prisoners that after a certain period they choose a life of dependence, free of the responsibility of caring for themselves. It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himself.
There are two distinct grounds on which the law might sensibly prohibit the possibility recognized in Exodus. First, the claim might be that freedom and its blessings represent a great gift that no individual »made in God's image« should be able to forfeit as though it were a disposable piece of property. Alternatively, the argument might be that in principle people have the right to choose to forego their freedom, but that in reality these choices are always influenced by personal necessities that becloud the choice actually made. This is especially true under market conditions, where the need for sustenance can drive people into relationships that they would not choose in and of themselves. It is clear that even the choice of the Hebrew slave discussed in Exodus can never be shown to be completely free. The legal arrangements also stipulate in the same passage that if during his period of servitude the slave acquired a wife or children, then he must leave them behind when he leaves his master's service. Some purchased servants might decide to opt for permanent servitude simply because they cannot bear to live without their wives and family. The full text in the quoted passage reads: »I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free.«12 The cruelty of subjecting him to the choice between freedom and leaving his family obviously means that his choice is not free in any meaningful sense.
Under modern capitalism there are many conditions that render choices less than fully free. Material necessity is the most obvious. But, as we have learned from the history of alcohol and cigarette consumption, advertising and peer group influence can lead people to develop habits that they later regret. The same is true of heroin consumption, which may readily develop into a condition of dependency in which the addict may enjoy the illusion of freely choosing not a hole bored in his ear but rather numerous telltale holes bored in his veins.
The question of exploitation and manipulation of consent has shifted from the economic to the sexual arena. That is why the peep show case so beautifully captures our concerns about equality and human dignity. The right to enter the romantic and sexual relationship of one's choosing is surely an important dimension of freedom. It includes the right to marry the person of one's choice, to choose and act upon a sexual orientation, gay or straight, to enjoy (within appropriate limits) reproductive freedom, and to say »no« to sex if one is so inclined.
The law of rape has become a major battleground of American law. The central question has become whether nominal consent to sexual relations constitutes actual consent, deep agreement in the heart. As in the economic context, power tends toward exploitation. The problem is particularly acute when the party seeking sexual favors---usually a man---is in a position of authority over his desired partner. The most hotly debated cases are spun from skepticism about whether nominal consent actually generates the kind of voluntary relationship that should be regarded as an expression of freedom rather than of exploitation. The same is true of regulation of sexual harassment on the job. If the boss promises advancement or threatens disadvantaged treatment on the job, the appearance of complete and voluntary participation is readily undermined. So far, in the name of equality, we are willing to tolerate rather intrusive regulation of dating practices in corporate or university settings, but one can sense a coming backlash favoring the principle that students old enough to vote should be old enough to make a responsible decision about their sexual lives. Making it a crime or private action for damages for coworkers or costudents to have sexual relations would surely violate the right to sexual autonomy now recognized as an aspect of liberty protected by the due process clause.
The problem of exploitation in apparently voluntary sexual relations has long been with us. In the late nineteenth century, the problem was whether the Mormon practice of polygamy should be regarded as protected as liberty and the free expression of religious conviction. Those who defended the institution, as provided in the accepted Mormon religious doctrines of the time, cited its social benefit of caring for all the women and children in a society in which the available men had fallen victim to the hardships of settlement and warfare. The critics, by contrast, claimed that the choice of the women in these cases is not really free and voluntary. John Stuart Mill, a great advocate of liberty, sided with the critics of polygamy. Western governments have had no qualms about prohibiting the practice, sometimes for parochial religious reasons, sometimes out of solicitude for women who are subjected to an institution that arguably diminishes their status. The Mormons sued, thinking they had the kind of argument that eventually prevailed in the Lochner case. In 1878, the Supreme Court upheld the conventional view that the prohibition represents permissible intervention by the state to protect the weak against entering into exploitative relationships. Many voices today argue that this decision was wrong. The freedom to choose any form of domestic arrangement one wants should prevail against the state's concern to protect people against their own potentially bad choices.
The same problem recurs in the current debate over physician-assisted suicide. The argument for freedom and autonomy holds that individuals should be able to choose when and how to end their lives. If they need the assistance of a physician to be able to die with dignity, they should have that right. The contrary view stresses the dangers of manipulated consent. Once the possibility of voluntary euthanasia is recognized, the danger presents itself that terminal patients will encounter social and economic pressure to consent to an early and painless death. Again, the problem is whether choices are as free as they seem on the surface, or whether they represent the subtle pressures that lead us to think that the government should intervene to protect people from manipulation and exploitation.
The anchor for this new conception of government---a government that intervenes in private choices in order to protect individuals from exploitation---lies in the Thirteenth Amendment. Yet, it seems very ambitious to derive all of this from a black-letter prohibition against private arrangements of »slavery and involuntary servitude.« The fact is that we are not entirely sure how far we should extend the prohibition against unjust relationships of domination. At the time the amendment was enacted, it was fairly clear that the drafters and the public had a broad construction in mind, for the Thirteenth Amendment became the constitutional foundation in 1866 for the first Civil Rights Act---indeed, the Act that is still used today to prosecute those who, like the police who beat up Rodney King, engage in racially motivated deprivations of civil rights. Because the deprivations of civil rights were understood to be an instantiation of relationships of unjust domination, it is clear that the framers envisioned a new constitutional order much broader than merely business as usual, just without slavery.
Academic writers have found the Thirteenth Amendment a rich source for constitutional speculation. Some have claimed that the amendment goes so far as to require the government to be watchful and intervene against child abuse. Others have argued that the amendment offers convincing grounds for recognizing abortion rights. Requiring a mother to carry a child to term arguably amounts to an oppressive form of involuntary servitude. A third voice holds, much in line with the argument of this book, that the potential ambit of »involuntary servitude« includes all forms of employment and labor that are unjust and oppressive. These are imaginative readings, and others are possible.
Some restraint is necessary. We have to be mindful of the prospect that the values of the Secret Constitution might play themselves out more effectively as the informal restraints of civil society rather than as binding rules of law. As we have seen, our impulse to promote religion, love for the nation, and »politically correct« speech seems to yield greater results when the state holds back and limits itself to a gentle nudge in the right direction. But, more significantly, we have to recognize that we are locked in ongoing contradiction between the values of our first and our second constitutions.
The first Constitution commits itself to freedom and the second builds both on a preference for equality and the recognition that freedom is often an illusion. The lovers of freedom want the government to keep its hands off, lest Big Brother's intermeddling do more harm than good. The skeptics of the Secret Constitution place their trust not in the natural mechanisms of social interaction but in the judgment of a vigilant hierarchy.
The first Constitution plays on the theme of distrust in government. We must secure our freedoms against potentially abusive officials seeking »rents« by pursuing their own bureaucratic interests. The second constitution presupposes trust in an aggressive government, a watchdog of transactions that might slide into the forbidden territory of »involuntary servitude.« In this regard, public opinion seems to be at odds with the de facto tolerance of Americans for governmental action that is becoming ever more intrusive. The public supposedly suffers from declining trust in government. Yet, in fact, the average person tolerates actions by government that can make sense only on the assumption that those potentially affected by governmental abuse see Washington officials as their allies in a common struggle. A good example is the census and the popular reaction. The census form for the year 2000, like several before it, poses probing questions about racial and ethnic identity. The government wants to know how many blacks and other minorities live in particular sections of the country. The questionnaire imposes a detailed grid of racial variations on people who might otherwise simply have thought of themselves as Americans or perhaps as »minorities.« This information becomes relevant, it is said, to Justice Department officials monitoring the distribution of voting power in congressional districts.
Americans would not cooperate in answering these questions if they did not trust the government not to misuse the collected information. There was a time when the government sought indirectly to find out how many Jews still spoke Yiddish at home. One can be sure that the purposes of early twentieth-century officials, ever concerned about swelling immigration patterns, were not benign. And yet, today the common assumption is that our officials may be trusted with a precise racial and ethnic map of the American nation. Popular attitudes even go beyond tolerance for the intrusion into our personal identities. Many people of multiracial backgrounds prefer to identify themselves as »black,« on the theory that it enhances the interests of the African- American population to appear as numerous as possible. For the government to serve as the vanguard of a new constitutional order, the people must trust officials in Washington with additional powers and run the risk of governmental abuse.
This trust makes sense---despite the surveys in which people report distrust---on the assumption that the nation chooses to cooperate in the ascendancy of the government as the watchdog of equality and popular democracy. The breach of equal treatment need not be feared, and information on the distribution of potential voting blocks serves the cause of securing fair representation of all major groups in American society.
Yet, the very effort to secure this fair representation of all voting groups threatens both the sense of common nationhood in the United States and calls into question the integrity of individual decision making in democratic elections. Encouraging people to identify themselves as hyphenated Americans encourages multicultural consciousness and generates a growing sense of puzzlement about what it means to say that all Americans are of a single nation. Also, the assumption that black candidates can be elected only by black voters places us on a path that we cannot pursue to a logical conclusion. It would hardly be consistent with the premises of popular democracy to consider---even as a thought-experiment---voting districts that consisted primarily of women or gays. The notion that particular groups are entitled to congressional representation merely as groups eventually runs squarely into the principle that in a democratic system individuals vote not as representatives of groups but solely as individuals. They have no duty to a hyphenated consciousness.
Yet, a trusted government can do much to remedy past discrimination and eliminate the badges of slavery. A new conception of government might yet emerge to realize the ambitions of Gettysburg, to ensure equality of all those »created equal« as it simultaneously promotes a »new birth of freedom.« It is as though nothing has been resolved. When the pursuit of equality begins to encroach upon our basic freedoms we are unsure where to turn.
ach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory. Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate. Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against   .   .   .   what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before? There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics. We are on shaky ground. Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.
We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf  the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight. The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark. But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom »intentionality« and »purpose« are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties. If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful  or more, a proper  definition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where »purpose« is ascribed by all of us to one another.
Semantics enters with purpose. For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious.
I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful, an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle, now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work, then do extract work, propagating work and constraint construction, from their environment.
Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now, plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material.
I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world. Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents. Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of »jobs« that were widely filled, the abundant niches of the bio-sphere. There is in this whole self-constructing system a wider know-how, beyond the know-how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment. Yet, clearly, the know-how is distributed. There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.
What in the world is »know-how«? Philosophers distinguish between »know-how« and »know that.« I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums. »Know that« concerns propositions, most conveniently, human propositions. I know that the moon is  they tell me  not made of green cheese. I know that the earth circles the sun, that the earth is roughly spherical, that chairs are used to sit on. »Know that« brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world. Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can »know that« with respect to propositions.
Unlike »know that,« »know-how« does not involve propositions about the world. »Know-how« involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world. The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest, the athletic genius high jumping, have the know-how to do it.
Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world? I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way. Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes, metabolic switching, mechanical twitching, sensing of glucose gradient, swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations. It knows how all right, even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business. But then, try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention.
Thank God for know-how. Know that is a thin veneer on a four-billion-year-old know-how skill abundant in the biosphere. But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how. If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.
The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents. The know-how is not outside that propagating organization. The know-how is the propagating organization.
All of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics.
It is simple at its roots, you see. An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else. 
Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view. The incoming molecule is »yuck« or »yum.« I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent. And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind. If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of agent, osprings of the first. If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.
Once yuck and yum, we are not far from C. S. Pierce's meaning-laden semiotic triad: sign, signified, significans. Like it or not, the glucose gradient is a sign, a predictor, of »more glucose that way.« Granted, the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol, any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain. In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified. By contrast, the relation between the word »chair« and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary. But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view? If so, can »mere chemicals« be signs in the full Piercean sense?
I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words. Consider first the famous genetic code. Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein. The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids, the binding of the charged transfer RNA's anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is »translated.«
The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules, which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid. As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site, the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis. The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site. Because of this, which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA. Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism. In short, chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations.
It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign, signified, and significans to the genetic code. It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous agents, as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that »warns« other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites.
The calculus that is Claude Shannon's elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols. Nowhere in the core of Shannon's work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning, or semantics, of the information enter. This is no criticism, and is widely known and appreciated. There is, however, just a hint of semantics in Shannon's view that the semantics resides in the »decoder.«
I cannot buy Shannon's view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent. If not, then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics  perhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways. The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding.
But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics. If only the bacterium could tell us: »Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me? I've run into that one before! I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me. I made it home. Pass me some more glucose please, Martha.«
I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold. Thus, among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds. Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing. I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from »intentional talk« to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question. But patience. Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translate  in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions  from legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and masses at space-time lines as a description.
Then let's just be naive for the moment. The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent  say, an early bacterium  is somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world. The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question.
»For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the horse was lost; and for want of the horse, the rider was lost,« more or less, said Benjamin Franklin. The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.
It seems hard to ascribe purpose, in the sense of acting on its own behalf, to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga. Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological. After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf. Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf. My definition is a definitional circle.
On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin's »natural selection« and »fitness,« that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world. Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents. All living cells are. And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf. Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest.
In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.
Daniel Dennett, in his fine book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, advances a hierarchy of forms of »knowing,« if I may use that term, that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means. I find his hierarchy congenial and informative. Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher-order entities via variation and natural selection.
I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution. Here, in Investigations, I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy, detect those sources of energy, create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy, and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further. I wonder, in short, at the naturalness and self-generaticity of Dennett's cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres, perhaps planetary geologies, and beyond.
But back to the past. Dennett distinguishes »Darwinian creatures,« »Pavlovian creatures,« »Popperian creatures,« and »Gregorian creatures.« A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature. In its simplest version, the creature evolves by mutation, also recombination and natural selection. For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered. So one (or a colony or an ecosystem) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us.
At the next level up, say, aplysia, a nervous system is present, and the creature is capable of stimulus-response learning, à la Pavlov. Indeed, aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimuli  the later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in »expectation« of food.
At the next level (Dennett, perhaps properly, reserves this for us vertebrates) is the Popperian creature. Popperian creatures, in Dennett's fine phrase, have »internal models« of their world and can »run the internal model« with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world. This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our »hypotheses to die in our stead.« I love that image.
Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature  namely, at least humans. Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools  literally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine tools  to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes. This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that. Cultural evolution, at some point, begins to burst out-of-bounds. Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran. Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom? Chinese cooking lands in Cuba, and Cuban-Chinese cuisine is invented. What's next under the sun? Who can say?
I very much like Dennett's ladder of know-how, and eventual know that. Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.
I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations. For example, bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already, for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level. This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter. As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus, why not envision a complex chemistry, say, very complex carbohydrate-synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves, which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism. Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates, the enzymes, and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus, then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops. The image is not too far from how it is imagined that »idiotype« and »anti-idiotype« immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen. In such networks, for which there is modestly good evidence, a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences, called the »idiotype« of the first antibody. In turn, the second »anti-idiotype« antibody stimulates a third, which stimulates a fourth. But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody, hence, the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space. It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system.
Popperian creatures? Why cannot the molecular-sensing and hypothesis-testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor, or not, such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by? Are nerves necessary? Plants, as noted, are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade. There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect, just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified. Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates.
I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures. Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole. If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.
I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks. We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail, I guess. Smart place, a biosphere, lots to talk about. Four billion years of yammering. Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago.
And what of ethics? Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents? Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent. There are deep reasons for caution. Hume told us long ago about the »naturalistic fallacy«: One cannot deduce »ought« from »is.« From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued. From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so.
Indeed, Hume's injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements. We scientists find the facts. You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics. But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all? Hume's injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category »ought.«
The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous. Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances. »It is wrong to kill.« Becomes, »Agggah!« Does the positivist argument seem persuasive? It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, »only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful,« is itself not empirically verifiable. One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards.
John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all »contractually« agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments. Thus »equality before the law« is one contract that Rawls commends to us. »Equality before the law« is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium. The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.
I will content myself with wondering where »value« and the rudiments of »intentionality« come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts. Where is the place of value in a world of fact?
So, a short soliloquy. Facts are know-that statements. But know-how preceded know that. While fully aware of Hume's injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent's perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent. I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria. Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere. Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli, or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.
And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present? If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid. Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible. You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control. To act ethically, you must first be able to act at all.
But what are »acts« in the first place? Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician. Now entering Harvard, Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive, after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard, where, at age fourteen, Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands. Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the »doings« of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent. Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner. But all sorts of molecular vibrational, rotational, and translational motions are occurring. What are actions and what are mere happenings?
I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics. But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan's happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli, tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general. We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism.
Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise? Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents. I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume's naturalistic fallacy. We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.
Architecture is hard to define. Goethe called it music frozen in space, which, while it captures a sense of rhythm, is too one-dimensional. And it relegates the mother of the arts to an inferior position; just as well to describe music as melted architecture. Nietzsche believed that architecture reflected his pride, man's triumph over gravity, and his will to power. This notion applies to many buildings, from Gothic cathedrals to skyscrapers, but it is too, well, Nietzschean. The British master Edwin Lutyens referred to architecture as a sort of play: »In architecture, Palladio is the game!« Le Corbusier described his art as »the masterly, correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in light,« which is a good description of one of his own buildings. I am partial to Sir Henry Wotton's definition. Wotton, who lived a long time in Venice and was a lover of architecture though not an architect, published a treatise on the subject in 1642. »In Architecture, as in all other Operative Arts, the end must direct the Operation,« he wrote. »The end is to build well. Well-building hath three conditions: Commoditie, Firmeness, and Delight.«
Sir Henry's description, which was based on the writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius, appeals to me because it emphasizes the complexity of the building art. To begin with, architecture has not one but three distinct purposes: to shelter human activity (commodity), to durably challenge gravity and the elements (firmness), and to be an object of beauty (delight). Architecture is always a synthesis of the three. However, the fulfillment of one purpose does not guarantee the satisfaction of the others. There are homely sturdy buildings and beautiful flimsy ones. A well-planned building can be ugly just as a beautiful building can function poorly. Form does not, contrary to Louis Sullivan's hoary maxim, follow function.
Not only are function and form separate, over their long lives buildings can successfully accommodate a variety of uses. For example, some of the most famous museums (the Louvre, the Hermitage, the Belvedere) started life as royal palaces; the Uffizi in Florence is so named because it originally housed offices; and the Prado in Madrid was designed to be a museum of science, not art. The acclaimed Musée d'Orsay in Paris is housed in a railroad station. Two of my favorite small museums, the Frick Collection in New York City and the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., were built as residences. As historic preservation and adaptive reuse demonstrate, you can shop in a renovated warehouse, do office work in a converted loft, or live in a barn. Assuming, of course, that the warehouse, the loft, and the barn were well built. The material fabric of old buildings---the heavy beams, rough brick walls, and solid woodwork---is one of their chief pleasures. That is why we feel cheated by hollow walls, flimsy doors, and shaky balustrades. Buildings should last and feel as though they will.
One might assume that just as the highest-rated cars---Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Lexus---represent the highest standards of automobile technology, the most admired architecture would be the best built. This was generally true in the past, but in the twentieth century, when new materials and new aesthetic theories often have driven architects to cavalier experimentation, even celebrated architects have fallen short in that department. Le Corbusier's white suburban villas, for example, were crudely finished in cement plaster on top of brick, and since the architect usually ignored (for aesthetic reasons) intrusive metal flashing and coping strips, the crude »machines for living« often aged poorly. Some Frank Lloyd Wright buildings have leaky skylights, sagging overhangs, and defective heating systems. This does not make them any less delightful to visit, but it must make them considerably less delightful to inhabit. Perhaps the most dramatic example of failed experimentation in recent years is the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, which opened in 1977. The building was widely praised for its architectural innovation---the British periodical Architectural Design called it »a seminal building of the Modern Movement.« The architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers turned the building literally inside-out. They dramatically hung pipes, ducts, fire stairs, elevators, and escalators from the exterior structure. These previously hidden elements were now exposed in plain sight---and exposed to the elements. The result might have been foreseen: after only twenty years, the French government was obliged to close the building for a two-year renovation. Although the authorities maintained that the renovation was required because of the unexpectedly large number of visitors, according to Le Monde almost half of the $90 million budget was spent on refurbishing the façade.
The University of Pennsylvania, where I teach, is the site of Louis I. Kahn's A. N. Richards Medical Research Laboratory. This structural tour-de-force of precast concrete and brick brought its designer international acclaim. I remember traveling from Montreal to Philadelphia as a student to see the building a few years after it was built. My classmates and I particularly admired the exposed concrete structure and the explicit separation of what Kahn called »servant« and »served« spaces---massive brick ventilation shafts and delicate, glass-enclosed individual laboratories. However, The latter proved to be unpopular with their occupants. The large windows let in too much light (today, most are papered over with aluminum foil), cement dust from the exposed concrete beams falls on the lab tables, and the rigid plan has proved inflexible to changing needs.
The Richards Laboratory was built only 35 years ago. It is next to a student dormitory known as the Quad, a picturesque Jacobean Revival complex planned around a series of courtyards. This handsome building has been doing yeoman service for almost a century. The Quad was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Walter Cope and John Stewardson, whose work at the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Bryn Mawr was largely responsible for the popularity of so-called Collegiate Gothic. Pleasing, well-loved---and well-built---the Quad is architecture of the highest order. Yet my classmates and I did not pay any attention to the dormitory when we visited Philadelphia years ago. We had never heard of Cope & Stewardson, despite their achievements and wide cultural influence. The architecture historians whom we studied---Siegfried Giedion, Nikolaus Pevsner, James Marston Fitch---favored innovators and experimenters, even if the innovations and experiments often failed. Put another way, most historians of modern architecture gave precedence to Delight over Commoditie and Firmeness. This may be because the appearance of a building was easier to assess (especially at a distance) than either its functional performance or material durability. Or maybe they were attracted chiefly to the aesthetic qualities of architecture. In any case, »imaginative, inventive, and revolutionary« were more likely accolades to be showered on important buildings than »accommodating, dependable, and sound.«
This is not to say that good architecture is merely utilitarian. One of the grandest spaces in Philadelphia is the concourse of Thirtieth Street Station, which was built in 1934 for the Pennsylvania Railroad by the accomplished Chicago architects Graham, Anderson, Probst & White, the successor firm of Daniel H. Burnham. The magnificent room, 290 feet long and almost 100 feet high, is covered by a flat coffered ceiling decorated in red, gold, and cream. Diffused light streams in from tall windows on both sides. Almost nothing in this memorable space---the gilded Art Deco chandeliers, the travertine walls, the massive Corinthian columns at each end---was a product of its rather mundane function: to provide a waiting space for people, before they descended the staircases that led to the platforms below. But the railroad station concourse in the heyday of railroad travel, was more than merely a place to get on and off trains. It was a gateway to the city, as well as a symbol of unreserved faith in modern transportation---and in the Pennsylvania Railroad. That is why it was appropriate for delight to take precedence over commodity.
Yet delight is not uniform. The Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, for example, offers different pleasures than Thirtieth Street Station. The monumental spaces are comparable in size and function. They are both well built. Similar spaces, similar materials, yet the experience of the two concourses is different. Both buildings are inspired by the Classical architecture of the past, but Grand Central, which opened in 1913, is a modified version of Beaux-Arts Classicism, whereas the Philadelphia station, despite the Corinthian columns, is simplified, abstracted, and stylized, what historians called »stripped Classicism.« As a result, Grand Central is dramatic, visually rich in its details, almost Wagnerian; Thirtieth Street is equally dramatic but in a way that is coolly geometrical and sleekly urbane---not Wagner, Cole Porter. Style is evident in the smallest details. It ensures a continuity between the great vaulted sky of Grand Central and the ticket counters, or between the Thirtieth Street chandeliers and the announcement boards at each track stair. It is the visual language of a building. Architectural style is the manner in which the architect communicates a particular kind of visual delight, in large ways and small.
Commodity, firmness, and delight are never evenly weighted. Sometimes one predominates, sometimes the other. Sometimes a waiting room needs to be a triumphal celebration of arrival and departure---sometimes it is just a waiting room. Sometimes it is necessary to compromise structural simplicity to achieve an esthetic effect. Sometimes functional requirements override other considerations; a laboratory that does not serve its scientists is a failed work of architecture, no matter how beautiful its design. A banal church is a greater failure than a banal factory. The art of building requires judiciously balancing Wotton's three conditions.
The end must direct the operation. That is what distinguishes architecture from the fine arts of painting and sculpture »An artist can paint square wheels,« Paul Klee once observed, »but an architect must make them round.« Architecture, in this respect, is no different than other »operative arts« such as cooking. The creativity of the chef is likewise circumscribed by factors outside his control---the natural ingredients, the human palate, the chemistry of foods. The dish must be at once nourishing (commodity), cookable (firmness), and, of course, tasty (delight). (It should also look good, although the contemporary trend toward visually extravagant dishes seems to me an aberration). The art of cooking, like the art of architecture, lies in knowing how to establish the appropriate relations between the three conditions.
The experience of food is sensual. It is also first-hand. That is, while it's fun to read recipes and look at photographs of table settings in Gourmet magazine, no one I know considers this a substitute for eating. The experience of buildings is sensual, too. Yet, many of us get our first glimpses of buildings---particularly celebrated buildings---as images in books, magazines, newspapers, public lectures, and exhibitions. One of the most famous buildings of the Modern movement, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion, was known almost entirely through photographs since it was built for an exhibition that lasted only seven months. Before photography, the Paimio Tubercolosis Sanatorium, located in a remote part of Finland, would have remained obscure; as it was, its stunning images brought the young Alvar Aalto worldwide recognition. The Sydney Opera House is another world-famous building that, at least outside Australia, relatively few people have seen first-hand. Yet photography tells us very little about how a building fulfills its function, or about how it is built. For example, the handrails in the often-photographed stairway of the Paimio sanatorium look like standard International Style metal pipes. In fact they are wood---much more pleasant to the touch---painted to look like metal. Well-known photographs of the Barcelona Pavilion show eight free-standing columns supporting a flat slab, and free-standing marble screens that carry no loads, a prototypical International Style structure. In reality, there are columns concealed within the screens, which are not slabs of marble but thin marble sheets attached to a masonry back-up wall. In other words, this 1929 building is an example of traditional layered construction, not of modernistic structural purism.
In photographs, buildings are forever young. The ravages of time, weather, and use are banished. It is a shock to come across a revered architectural icon and to find the concrete stained, the painted window frames chipped, the tiles cracked. Of course, all buildings age, but some age more gracefully than others. A 450-year-old Palladio villa retains its beauty, despite peeling plaster and mossy stonework (perhaps it even looks more enchanting). Most modern buildings, on the other hand, lose their potency if they are not gleaming and machinelike.
Obviously, photography highlights the visual qualities of buildings and ignores commodity and firmness. Yet photography cannot completely communicate delight. A visitor to the Seagram Building in New York, for example, is surprised to discover the subtle relationship between Mies' bronze tower and the Italian Renaissance façade of McKim, Mead & White's Racquet and Tennis Club on the other side of Park Avenue. Equally deceptive are photographs of Frank Lloyd Wright's work in Oak Park, since they give no hint of the comfortable suburban surroundings of his so-called prairie houses. As I student, I studied the buildings of Le Corbusier in black and white photographs, which did not prepare me for the shock of experiencing his often wildly polychrome interiors. Nor can photography communicate movement, which is such an integral part of the architectural experience (film is better at this, but not much). Nothing conveys the actual experience of a building like the real thing. To paraphrase Robert Hughes, a photograph of architecture is to architecture as telephone sex is to sex.
Never is modern architectural photography more misleading than in its portrayal of domestic interiors. Interiors are usually photographed empty or with minimal furnishings, before the owners have had the opportunity to move in and (presumably) defile the purity of the design. But even if the space is occupied, strict conventions prevail: furniture must be lined up just so; there must be no distractions, no half-empty tea cups, no crumpled newspapers, no abandoned children's toys. Books on shelves are arranged to create interesting patterns, personal mementos are temporarily banished---everything must be neat. I once observed a photographer's assistant during a photo shoot comb out the fringe of a rug. Such primping and visual editing sets off the architecture to best advantage. It also---not coincidentally---gives the impression that the designed interior is autonomous and self-contained: in other words, that it is a work of art. Markedly, these photographs never include human figures. People would be the greatest distraction of all.
The world of buildings depicted in books and magazines is a scaleless, self-sufficient place. The absence of people in architectural photographs has several effects. In the past, the proportions and dimensions of buildings were based on the human body. While this was done for philosophical reasons, it also ensured a direct relationship between architecture and people---it is why even very large Classical buildings feel comfortable. By removing people from buildings, architectural photography makes it possible to regard architecture as an abstraction, unrelated to humans. It is not merely that the conventions of modern architectural photography ideally communicate the intentions of most modern architects, it is also that they validate those intentions. People? Who needs them?
While I was writing Home, I discovered that the most useful historical sources for information about how people furnished and decorated their homes were often paintings. Not paintings in which the room was the subject, but portraits and domestic genre scenes. An example of the latter is James Tissot's, »Hide and Seek,« which shows four little girls at play in a Victorian sitting room. The décor is exotic, an eclectic mixture of Persian rugs, Chinese porcelain pots, and tiger-skins and others furs scattered over the furniture.
Tissot was a French painter who settled in London in 1871. An easel in the corner suggests that this is his own house, in which case, the woman sunk deep into an easy chair, reading a newspaper may be his Irish mistress. John Singer Sargent's masterpiece, »The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit,« painted in 1882, likewise shows four girls. Henry James described it as »the happy play-world of a family of charming children,« but the girls can hardly be said to be playing. Properly dressed in white pinafores, black socks, and patent leather shoes, they form a motionless tableau. The room, in an apartment in Paris, is stylishly bare, unadorned except for two immense Japanese vases and a red screen. The mood is entirely different in the Swedish painter Carl Larsson's playful »Mother's and the Cherubs' Room,« which was included in Larsson's famous book Ett Hem (At Home), published in 1899. The walls of his wife's bedroom are wooden boards, whitewashed and decorated with a painted frieze of ribboned garlands; the ceiling, likewise wood, is painted green with red trim. The simple furniture is also painted in bright colors. Karin Larsson's bed is separated from the children's cots by a striped woven curtain. We see three of the Larsson girls in various stages of dress---and undress. That is appropriate, too, for naturalism and artlessness permeate this charming scene.
Such paintings are more faithful depictions of domestic surroundings than modern architectural photographs. For one thing, they are full of the signs of everyday life. A coat is thrown casually over a chair, there are crumbs on the table, Tissot's little girl playing on the floor rumples the carpet. Moreover, in these interiors the architecture is in the background. It is a setting for human activity---just as it is in real life. Paintings also convey something about the atmosphere of the interior. Dutch seventeenth-century domestic paintings, for example, exude a prosperous air of bourgeois comfort and propriety. A hundred years later, François Boucher painted a middle-class French family gathering for morning coffee in a little room with japanned woodwork and gilded moldings. There is a sweet intimacy here that is absent in the Dutch interiors. An interior of the same period by Henry Walton shows an English gentleman at breakfast. He is sitting in a relaxed posture, wearing a riding-coat and boots, accompanied by his dog. The ambience is one of informal and relaxed country life.
As I studied such paintings, I started to see associations between the rooms and their inhabitants. The legs of the mahogany furniture in an English country house were as straight and unadorned as their owners' riding boots. The arabesques and curlicues of the moldings and architectural ornaments in a French salon mirrored the flouncing ribbons that adorned the women's dresses and the frills of the men's shirts. The proper black broadcloth and white lace collars of the Dutch men and women echoed the spotless black-and-white checkerboard marble floors. I became convinced that a strong connection exists between the way that we decorate our homes and the way that we dress ourselves.
There are three distinct reasons for the intimate relationship between dress and décor. The first is technical. Décor, like dress, incorporates fabrics. Curtains, swags, and window-treatments are made of silk, damask, satin, brocade, wool, muslin, and velvet---so is clothing. Woven materials are used in tapestries, wall-hangings, carpets and upholstery as well as coats and skirts. Inevitably, the dressmaker's techniques of embroidering, gathering, pleating, and trimming find their way into décor. This is why furniture skirts recall women's skirts, and why the fringes, cords, and bobbins of nineteenth-century drapery recall ladies' ballgowns. The delicate lace curtains and the billowing baldachin over a bed in a ladies' boudoir matched the clothes in her dressing room.
The connection between décor and dress can be even more intimate, for architecture sometimes directly mimics dress. The garlands in eighteenth-century buildings are sculpted or painted versions of the sashes and flowered ornaments worn by men and women. The ancient Greeks incorporated elements of dress in temple architecture. This is most apparent in colonnades, which Vincent Scully has likened to hoplites massed in a phalanx. There is no doubt that Classical columns were given human attributes. Ancient authors likened the vertical flutes to the folds in a chiton, or tunic. Columns have capitals---that is, heads. The moldings of Doric capitals were sometimes painted to resemble headbands; Ionic and Corinthian capitals incorporated carved head garlands, and the curving tendrils of Corinthian capitals often look more like hair than foliage. Indeed, Vitruvius considered the Corinthian order »feminine,« as opposed to the sturdy masculine Doric. Sir Henry Wotton went so far as to call the Corinthian order »lascivious« and »decked like a wanton courtesan.«
The second connection between dress and décor is social. In the 1890s, the famous English economist Alfred Marshall observed that as people earned more money, they wanted better food, better clothes and larger homes---both for social standing and comfort. Since homes and clothes are timeworn ways in which to convey status, there is a conformity in the types of materials and symbols used to convey social standing. If family coats of arms are displayed, they will be seen on wall medallions as well as on blazer buttons. If gold is treasured, the wealthy will wear gold braid and surround themselves with gilt moldings. If this is considered too flashy, other materials can convey status: stainless steel kitchen appliances and stainless steel watch bracelets. Diamonds may be forever, but fashions change. Today, leather is considered a luxury material, and is used both for expensive clothing and expensive sofas. A hundred years ago, leather was considered utilitarian; leather aprons and vests were worn only by workmen, and leather easy chairs were only found in smoking rooms and men's clubs since leather was less flammable than fabric. But it was never used in salons or drawing rooms. When corduroy, originally used only in workingmen's dress, became accepted by the middle class, it also showed up as upholstery. The current fashion for »natural« dress fabrics---cotton, wool, linen---has a counterpart in »natural« décor: exposed brick, oiled wood, polished concrete.
In a more general sense---and this has nothing to do with conspicuous consumption---both homes and clothes convey values. Carl Larsson's home was a statement of both his and Karin's naturalistic aesthetic ideals, so was James Tissot's exotic sitting room. Whether or not we are artists, our homes, like our clothes, communicate who we are, or at least how we wish others to perceive us: starchly formal or comfortably casual, intensely avant-garde or resolutely traditional, bohemian or conservative, cosmopolitan or down-home. The Che Guevara poster on the wall and the embroidered denim jacket convey one set of values; Colonial break-fronts and penny loafers, another. That is why it is disconcerting if dress and décor are not in harmony. Sweat shirts and running shoes in a Louis Quinze drawing room send a decidedly mixed message, as does a three-piece suit on the deck of a Malibu beach bungalow.
The third connection between dress and décor concerns perception. Architecture, interior decoration, and fashion design are three distinct fields, yet we experience them with the same eye. Whether we look at dress or décor, we bring the same visual bias, the same sensibility, the same taste. This sensibility is not constant. Sometimes we appreciate simplicity, sometimes complexity. Fashionable seventeenth-century French eyes, for example, favored floral decorations and embroidery, and introduced the custom of having vases of fresh flowers in the home. English eyes in the midst of the Neoclassic revival sought fundamental simplicity and sobriety in men's clothes as well as in architecture. Victorian eyes fancied dense patterns that were likely to show up in waistcoats and on wainscotting. Parisian eyes, in the early 1900s, admired the same neo-Empire motifs in dress and décor.*
Early twentieth-century eyes had their own particular sensibility. One of the great interiors of this period is the main living space of the Tugendhat House, designed by Mies Van der Rohe in 1928. The house stands outside Brno, Czechoslovakia. The exterior is a low-key International Style white box, but the interior is astonishing. The public rooms are contained in one large open space. A curved wall of macassar ebony defines the dining room, and a straight free-standing wall of onyx dorée separates the music room from the living room. The space is punctuated by slender cruciform columns covered in chromed metal. The east and south walls are floor-to-ceiling glass---a precursor of Mies' famous glass house. The sense of openness is heightened when, at the touch of a button, fifteen-foot sections of the glass wall sink into the ground.
I have never seen the Tugendhat House, except in a handful of black-and-white photographs (the house was severely damaged during the Second World War). This is another case where photographs are a poor substitute. They do not convey the rich textures of the raw silk and velvet draperies, nor the vivid colors of the upholstery: emerald green leather and ruby-red velvet. Nor do they capture the sumptuous range of materials: onyx, pearwood, handwoven wool, chromed metal and (surprisingly) a linoleum floor. Since the surviving photographs do not show any human figures, they heighten the impression that the house was built yesterday, especially as the furniture, designed by the architect, is still in production.
Mies van der Rohe appears in a photograph taken in 1926. The place is Stuttgart, the site of the famous Weissenhof housing exhibition, which he planned, and where he brought together the leading exponents of the soon-to-be-christened International Style. One of these was Le Corbusier, who is also in the photograph. The two firebrands, who will soon set the architectural world on its ear, are deep in conversation. Le Corbusier smokes a pipe and sports a jaunty derby and a loose, short tweed coat. Mies, looking older than his forty years, wears a Homburg, a long dark ulster, and spats. This photograph puts the Tugendhat House in context. However »modern« the airy room appears to my eyes, it contained a considered and formal way of life that is as remote from me as waxed moustaches, Homburgs, and spats. It is in that context that Mies' curious combination of ordered simplicity and sybaritic luxury must be understood.
Nothing could be less similar to the Tugendhat House than Charles Moore's weekend house that he built for himself in the hills above Berkeley, California. I saw it in the summer of 1964, two years after it was built. While the Tugendhat House appears sexy and glamorous, the Moore house is at first glance downright rustic, a little barn, twenty-six feet square, capped by a saddle roof. It is an elegant little barn, however, with white-painted walls and large windows that open up the corners, not by disappearing into the ground but by sliding sideways like barn doors. The one-room interior contains a grand piano and a sunken bath that looks vaguely Roman, perhaps because the skylight above it is supported by four solid fir Tuscan columns (found by Moore at a demolition site). Four similar columns support a second skylight over a sitting area.
I admire the Tugendhat House, but I could not imagine living in it. That is, I could not imagine having to dress up sufficiently to feel at home. The Moore house, on the other hand, reflects a more compliant sensibility. Its floor-to-ceiling windows, spare detailing, and open interior mark it as a successor to the International Style. Yet the shingled roof and the Tuscan columns hearken back to older traditions. The little building manages to be comfortable, relaxed, archetypal, and vaguely ironic, all at the same time. The eclectic, Californian setting is both informal and formal. Put another way, it is a place where people who wear tweed jackets with jeans, or silk skirts with canvas espadrilles would fit right in.
The little Moore barn is an historic building. Together with Robert Venturi's Vanna Venturi House, which was designed the same year, it marks the advent of an architectural style that became known as Postmodernism. One of the celebrated buildings of Postmodernism is James Stirling's Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, which was completed in 1984. Stirling vastly expands Moore's eclecticism, combining a bewildering mixture of forms; a Doric portico, a staid neoclassical wing that matches the existing museum, an Egyptian-looking curved cornice, a colorful Russian Constructivist entrance canopy, a curving steel-and-glass wall, and two huge blue ventilator funnels lifted straight from the Centre Georges Pompidou. The monumental façade of alternating bands of travertine and sandstone is undermined by oversized fiberglass handrails that look like pink sausages. I couldn't understand this design, except as a tour-de-force, until I visited the building. It was a wintry Sunday, and the Staatsgalerie was packed---it is one of the most popular museums in Germany. Now the architecture made sense. This museum-cum-discotheque was the perfect setting for the eclectic crowd. We were wearing every type of dress imaginable: casual wear, business suits, ski parkas, work clothes. Some people dressed up for a Sunday visit to the museum, some dressed down. Stirling's lively collage absorbed us all. I did not see any gentlemen in Homburgs and spats, but they would have fitted in, too.
A number of years ago I accompanied the architect Jack Diamond on a visit to a building that he had just completed at York University in Toronto. It was a student center, containing a food court and lounges on the main level and student organization offices on the second floor. The exterior of the building was decidedly traditional. Facing a landscaped common, the well-proportioned façade consisted of a colonnaded brick base supporting a row of double columns capped by a deep copper-lined cornice. Behind the colonnade, which was fitted with retractable glass panels that could be opened during warm weather, was a two-story-high hall lit by three large skylights. The exterior had a simplicity that reminded me of McKim, Mead & White, albeit without Classical ornament.
The interior was different, with many hallmarks of the International Style: no decoration, bare concrete, exposed structural beams, factory sash glazing and steel pipe railings. I assumed that the stark simplicity was the result of a restricted budget, and a desire to use materials that would withstand wear and tear. It seemed pretty banal to me, and although I didn't say anything to Jack, I was disappointed. Yet as we walked around, I changed my mind. Although the décor was tough and unsentimental, it was not crude. There were sleek stainless-steel pendant lighting fixtures with suspended glass diffusers and stylish easy chairs covered in canvas. In the food court, the bar and counter tops were marble, the dining tables solid maple. Students were gathered around tables, lounging on the staircase, sprawled on the floor. The atmosphere was hard to pin down. This was not the precious, corporate modernism of Richard Meier, nor the contrived, technological wizardry of Norman Foster. It was certainly not the Calvinist minimalism that I associated with many trendy younger architects. I couldn't put my finger on it until I realized that the functional but chic décor reminded me of the no-nonsense styling of a Benetton clothing store.
I happen to like Collegiate Gothic buildings. I like their dark rooms with wood paneling, hammer-beam ceilings, and traditional oak furniture. But seeing the York student center made me realize that whenever I walk through these old buildings I also experience a nagging dissatisfaction. It has to do with the students. The young men and women in baseball caps, shorts, stenciled sweat shirts, and iridescent nylon windbreakers just don't fit in. They should be wearing boaters and blazers, tweeds and flannels. Of course, no student that I have ever seen---including at Oxford---dresses that way. I may deplore the loss of decorum, but as an architect I can't do anything to change it. It is the building that must do the accommodating.
If the relationship between dress and décor is intimate, it is also one-sided. Interior decorators and architects will bridle at this, but there is no doubt that dress comes first. »People have always worn what they wanted to wear,« writes Anne Hollander, »fashion exists to keep fulfilling that desire.« And architecture must follow. For the truth is that a building---no matter how useful or well built or beautiful---that is not sympathetic to the way that people dress risks looking not merely anachronistic, but downright silly. Like it or not, architecture cannot escape fashion.
