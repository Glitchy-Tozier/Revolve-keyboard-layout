* New Parameter: No similar keys in similar positions (too easy to mix up).
* Recheck the single key costs.
* Test the single key costs against the Truly Ergonomic and do minor tweaks. The main target is the standard keyboard, though!
* Decision: e and n on index or middle finger, or e on index and n on middle? â†’ fix before optimizing instead of discussing it to death later: All of them can give good layouts.
